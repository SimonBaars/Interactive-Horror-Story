{"id":284,"name":"The Nightmare","paragraphs":["You lie down on the altar, feeling utterly exhausted after the intense fight. As you close your eyes, you feel as if you're drifting off into a peaceful sleep. However, your dreams soon turn into a horrifying nightmare. You see strange creatures crawling out of the shadows and approaching you with sinister intent. You try to move or scream, but you're paralyzed with fear.","Suddenly, something pulls you back into reality. You open your eyes and see that the cultists have returned. They look at you with a mixture of anger and amusement. One of them steps forward and says, \"You foolish mortal. Did you really think you could escape our grasp so easily?\"","The cultists seize you and drag you towards the symbol etched into the floor. You realize too late that it's a portal to another dimension. You scream and struggle, but it's no use. You're pushed into the portal and feel yourself being pulled into a void of darkness.","You wake up with a start, drenched in sweat. It takes you a few moments to realize that it was all just a terrible nightmare. You look around and see that you're back in the hospital room with your parent, who is now awake and smiling at you. You breathe a sigh of relief and promise yourself that you will never forget the lesson you learned about denial and facing your fears."],"imageIds":["4e55a19f-733d-41eb-b0bb-d84e2ea9fc3f","41077137-9b2d-41bf-b52b-34af4ed40397","eae0b1ef-fcbe-4501-bbd1-2f7aff2a5cce","cf8bc302-5a6b-4cfa-93e1-efc08d1716d5"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":101}
