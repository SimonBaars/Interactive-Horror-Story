{"id":298,"name":"The Escape","paragraphs":["You flee the hospital as fast as you can, not looking back. As you run down the street, you hear a series of loud explosions coming from behind you. You turn around and see that the hospital has caught fire and is now burning violently. Sirens wail in the distance as emergency vehicles rush to the scene.","You stop running and catch your breath, watching as the hospital burns to the ground. It's then that you realize that you'll never know what really happened there. You'll never find out what caused the chaos and destruction, or whether your parent made it out alive. All you're left with is the memory of what you witnessed and the knowledge that you narrowly escaped with your own life.","For months after the incident, you're plagued by nightmares and flashbacks. You try to move on with your life, but the trauma stays with you. Eventually, you seek help from a therapist who helps you process what you saw and experienced. Slowly but surely, you begin to heal.","Even years later, the memory of the burning hospital haunts you. But you draw strength from the fact that you survived, and you're determined to make the best of the life you have left. You vow to never take anything for granted again, knowing that at any moment, everything can change in an instant."],"imageIds":["ac29e895-d3c2-4bbf-b4bc-1d2a33fa0e20","143e97c7-0089-4adb-a079-2c2cfde674c5","ac80807b-af02-4e91-a1d8-e56f1f2b4a38","b475555b-9a5e-40e5-a03f-2f586e766a7c"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":113}
