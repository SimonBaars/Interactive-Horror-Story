As you search, you notice strange patterns etched into their skin that seem almost like a language. You take out your phone and snap some pictures, hoping to decode them later.

These creatures were created in a secret government lab as part of a bioweapons program.

You vow to expose the truth and put an end to the madness once and for all."],"imageIds":["b23a3ba1-4e2c-431d-8aad-d3add751beab","82bd5bf5-a033-46f3-af97-f509b8bf41b5"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":304}
