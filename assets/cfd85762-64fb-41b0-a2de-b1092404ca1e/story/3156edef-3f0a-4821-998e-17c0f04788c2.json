You try to slow your breathing and steady your heart rate, hoping that it will buy you some time.","After what feels like an eternity, the figure finally seems satisfied that you're dead. It lets go of you and begins to shuffle away down the hallway. You wait until it's out of sight before slowly getting to your feet.","You take one last look around the abandoned building before making a run for it. You burst out into the daylight and gasp for air, feeling like you've just escaped from hell itself. But as you look around, you realize that you have no idea where you are or how to get home.","You start walking, hoping that you'll stumble upon something familiar. It takes hours, but eventually, you spot a familiar landmark in the distance. You run towards it, tears streaming down your face, and collapse into the arms of your loved ones. You know that you'll never forget this experience, but for now, all that matters is that you're safe."],"imageIds":["80b27d65-1389-4c34-a322-7f8cbdfe019f","a22624c8-fa78-4b89-94a1-b658da3c4310","87afb1e0-cf49-4f06-9094-c22c265c2a74","ea2e6d11-30ed-48e7-9678-d395e291536b"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":25}
