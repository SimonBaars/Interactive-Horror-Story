{"id":173,"name":"The Rescue Mission","paragraphs":["You take a deep breath and quietly open the door to the darkened ritual chamber. Inside, you see your parent lying on a table, surrounded by the chanting figures. You move slowly and quietly towards them, trying not to make a sound.","Suddenly, one of the figures spots you and lets out a piercing scream. The others turn to face you, their eyes glowing in the dim light. You know that you're outnumbered and outmatched, but you refuse to give up. You charge at them, swinging a nearby object like a weapon.","You fight with all your might, dodging attacks and striking back whenever you can. In the end, you manage to defeat the figures and free your parent. As you make your way out of the room, you hear sirens approaching in the distance. You know that you need to leave quickly if you want to avoid getting caught."],"imageIds":["a4e8bf75-8582-41f8-87a2-38567381689e","df7cdd8d-1636-4267-9c41-869c44812c37","673a4e1e-35ef-452e-af2e-88a5ba18c6cb"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":2}
