{"id":498,"name":"The Power of Symbols","paragraphs":["You spend years studying the symbols and their power, learning to harness their energy for good. You use them to heal the sick, to protect the weak, and to bring hope to those who are lost. And with each passing day, your mastery over them grows stronger.","But as you delve deeper into the symbols' mysteries, you begin to uncover something disturbing. There are whispers of a prophecy, one that speaks of a great calamity that will befall the world. And at the center of it all is you, the wielder of the symbols.","You try to ignore the prophecies, telling yourself that they're just legends. But deep down, you know that there's truth to them. And so, you begin to prepare. You gather allies, train apprentices, and build wards against the darkness. You do everything in your power to ensure that when the time comes, you'll be ready.","And then, one fateful night, the prophecy comes true. The sky cracks open, and from the rift pours forth a horde of eldritch monsters. They swarm across the land, leaving destruction in their wake. But you stand firm, drawing upon the symbols' power to hold them back. And in that moment, you realize what the hidden meaning behind the symbols truly was: the power to create and the power to destroy, all in one."],"imageIds":["63e386da-12a9-4240-99f5-125fe939a243","1863d45a-099a-422b-94b0-86a974e4683f","25749522-d3b2-49d1-bfe1-37a5227593bf","e760885f-8f3f-420c-85c4-8e7e13859b0e"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":287}
