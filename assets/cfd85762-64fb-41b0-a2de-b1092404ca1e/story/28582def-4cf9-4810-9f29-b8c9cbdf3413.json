{"id":271,"name":"The Aftermath","paragraphs":["You tell the hospital authorities everything that happened, and they look at you like you're crazy. But then they start investigating, and they discover that there have been other reports of strange occurrences in the hospital. They thank you for bringing it to their attention and give you a voucher for a free flu shot.","As you leave the hospital, you feel a sense of closure and relief. You realize that you've gone through something truly terrifying but managed to come out the other side. You decide to treat yourself to some ice cream, and as you're eating it, you see a group of people in Ghostbusters costumes walking by. You chuckle to yourself and remember the time you fought a real-life ghost.","You know that the memories of the haunted hospital will stay with you forever, but you also feel like you've grown stronger because of it. As you walk away, you hear someone call your name. It's the survivor who helped you fight off the creature in the hospital. They thank you for showing bravery and offer to buy you a drink. You smile and accept, grateful for the newfound friendship."],"imageIds":["caae90f2-c6f0-430a-a1dd-82d2ee11762d","628b02c7-21d1-4722-bd61-a600432c8447","f63e6a30-b4fa-4f84-ba5b-3c1848012536"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":89}
