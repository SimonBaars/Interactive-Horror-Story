As you see their face, you can't help but burst out laughing - it's just the hospital's janitor! \"What are you doing here?\" you ask, still chuckling at the absurdity of it all.","The janitor looks embarrassed as they explain that they were just trying to clean up the lab. They didn't realize that anyone was still in there, and they were too scared to speak up when they heard you enter. You feel a little bad for scaring them, but you're also relieved that the mystery is solved.","You both share a laugh about the situation, and the janitor offers to walk you to the door. As you make your way through the hospital, you feel grateful for the small moments of levity that have helped you get through such a stressful experience. As you step outside into the cool night air, you take a deep breath and feel a sense of peace wash over you. It's over, and you made it through."],"imageIds":["6a8beea5-dc71-4a36-846a-f23a0c189182","953bc262-3fea-4cb2-b274-abf40dc45e6b","7debf76e-a9a0-4d16-9ec9-1f00d852c556"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":276}
