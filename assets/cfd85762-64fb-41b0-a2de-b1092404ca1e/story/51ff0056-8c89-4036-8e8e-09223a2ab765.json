{"id":322,"name":"Exploring the Unknown","paragraphs":["You start to explore the abandoned wing of the hospital, your footsteps echoing in the empty halls. As you walk, you notice that the walls are covered in strange symbols and diagrams, as if someone was trying to summon something from another world.","You come across a room with a strange machine in the center, its wires and cords snaking out into the darkness. As you approach it, you feel a strange energy emanating from the device, as if it's alive in some way.","Suddenly, you hear a noise behind you, and you spin around to see a group of people wearing lab coats and goggles rushing towards you. They start babbling incoherently, saying something about \"time experiments\" and \"alternate dimensions.\" You back away slowly, unsure of what to do next.","Just when you think you're done for, a group of police officers burst into the room, guns drawn. They yell at the scientists to put their hands up and surrender. You take the opportunity to slip away unnoticed, making a mental note to stay far away from St. Mary's Hospital from now on."],"imageIds":["b60d2292-f433-4f7a-9126-a8a64edffefb","783e5cc7-5d10-43c9-b823-96169bea3097","d2a86051-df52-4be3-9135-8ea8607b9f66","e245dd53-da35-484b-b554-19654a09385e"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":137}
