As you're munching on them, you notice that there's something odd inside the bag - a slip of paper with strange symbols drawn on it.","You try to make sense of the symbols but can't seem to find any meaning in them. Just as you're about to give up, you notice that one of the symbols matches the ones that were etched into your parent's forehead. Your heart starts racing as you realize that there may be a connection between the two.","Suddenly, the door to the hospital bursts open, and a group of people rush in, chanting in the same language as the figures from before. They're carrying what looks like a body wrapped in a sheet. As they pass by you, one of them drops a slip of paper identical to the one you found in your bag of chips. You realize that something sinister is happening in this hospital, and you need to figure out what it is before it's too late."],"imageIds":["9c037ea8-3694-4d1f-aa36-25ea8949509f","e6012ef7-f933-44ad-9b47-55daffcab938","1eb47384-0205-4baa-bb5a-464d90555ff7"],"optionNames":["Follow the group","Look for more clues"],"optionDescriptions":["You choose to follow the group and see where they're taking the body.","You decide to look for more clues about what's happening in the hospital."],"optionIds":["52668e7f-f9b8-45c6-97c7-9d52c272a3a1","7a5e4d8e-73d3-48c9-abb6-42385ee137f0"],"optionImageIds":["510ffd21-0e7d-4987-8721-d6ad6d0bfbf5","edceed70-b28e-4b72-a979-f3eaeaac1a21"],"ending":-1}
