It growls at you menacingly, but you stand your ground and draw a funny face on its forehead. To your surprise, the creature begins to laugh. Its skin turns from pale to rosy, and its eyes lose their eerie glow. The creature thanks you for helping it find its sense of humor and disappears into thin air.","You smile to yourself, feeling relieved that the nightmare is finally over. You realize that sometimes laughter really is the best medicine. As you turn to walk away, you bump into someone. It's the store clerk from earlier, who hands you a business card and tells you that they're starting a comedy club in town. You look at the card in disbelief and start to feel a glimmer of hope. Maybe things are starting to look up after all."],"imageIds":["7b4877b2-8f8d-4588-b71a-6fd24c8ce924","a455c0f5-1c7e-4a75-93a6-168924c317c4"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":30}
