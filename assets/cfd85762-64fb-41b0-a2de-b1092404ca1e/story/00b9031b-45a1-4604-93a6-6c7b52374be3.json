You take a deep breath and try to calm down, realizing that it was all just a bad dream.","As you wipe away your tears, you start to notice something strange. The hospital room looks different than before, almost like it's glitching. You look around, confused, and then you realize what's happening. This isn't real life. You're still inside the nightmare.","Suddenly, a bright light fills the room, and everything goes white. You feel weightless, as if you're floating through space. Then, just as suddenly, you find yourself sitting at a computer terminal, staring at lines of code on a screen.","You blink, trying to make sense of what just happened. Then, you hear a voice behind you. \"Congratulations,\" it says. \"You've beaten the game.\" You turn to see a group of developers standing there, smiling.

It was all part of an elaborate virtual reality experience."],"imageIds":["1cb37fc8-904e-4e98-98a3-a00138391632","1bd9a29f-3a5b-4958-96da-cf5c361d8203","9762ad08-15be-45f4-a637-225dbf20e31f","4517848a-e335-433b-9c48-3a3706b09f35"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":40}
