{"id":217,"name":"The Nightmare","paragraphs":["You look up at your parent and tell them that you want to stay in this nightmare. They shake their head sadly and start to fade away. As they disappear, the hospital room around you starts to warp and twist, becoming even more twisted and grotesque than before. The creatures lurking in the shadows start to move closer, and you realize that you've made a terrible mistake.","You try to run, but it feels like you're moving through quicksand. The creatures close in, and you can feel their icy breath on your skin. Just as you think all is lost, you remember something your parent said earlier. \"You can always wake yourself up.\" You focus on that thought and try to force yourself awake once again.","This time, it works. You open your eyes to find yourself back in your own bedroom, safe and sound. Your heart is still racing as you try to process what just happened. As you lay there in bed, you realize that maybe the nightmare was a metaphor for something else. Maybe it's time to face your fears and stop running away from them."],"imageIds":["2ce98b40-def2-4687-9b3e-d757f8e0d092","f01d5c37-38b8-40ac-88f6-744786c0db6d","993b37fc-0ed3-49d3-b51a-489ace7f48c1"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":41}
