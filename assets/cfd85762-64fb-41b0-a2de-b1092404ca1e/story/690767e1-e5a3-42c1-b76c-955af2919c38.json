{"id":376,"name":"The Source","paragraphs":["You make your way through the hospital, fighting off creatures as you go. Finally, you reach a dimly lit room with strange machinery and devices. In the center of the room, you see a figure in a lab coat, hunched over a desk. As you approach, the figure turns to face you, revealing its twisted, inhuman features. It's the source of the creatures.","You lunge at the figure with your weapon, but it dodges easily and knocks you to the ground. As you struggle to get up, the figure starts monologuing about their experiments and how they've been trying to create the perfect life form. You realize that there's no reasoning with this monster and that you have to stop it by any means necessary. With one final burst of strength, you manage to strike the creature with your weapon, destroying it and causing the machinery to explode. The creatures around the hospital start to disintegrate, and the police finally arrive to take control of the situation. You're battered and bruised, but you've saved your parent and put an end to the nightmare."],"imageIds":["8e47233f-8c5d-417f-b363-7d3068b704d3","61c34860-389f-4834-93c5-4eed8a95a8f8"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":181}
