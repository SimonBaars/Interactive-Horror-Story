You feel their energy flowing through you, but instead of embracing it, you try to direct it towards the cell door. With a burst of willpower, you blast the door open, sending it flying off its hinges.","You run down the dark hallway, the symbols still pulsing in your mind.

And you know that you'll never be the same again."],"imageIds":["dc763032-2582-456a-941d-1767e75cb062","970d17d1-cd27-4a12-94b4-8922f97894bb","bddb16d8-6993-4967-b6fe-f08f6b147e74"],"optionNames":["Report everything to the authorities","Keep everything to yourself and try to move on with your life","Seek out other people who have experienced similar things"],"optionDescriptions":["You decide to report everything you've seen to the authorities, even though it may put your own safety at risk.","You try to put everything that's happened behind you and move on with your life, even if it means keeping the truth from others.","You search for others who have had similar experiences, hoping to find answers and support."],"optionIds":["6e16ceb5-d225-42fe-8910-432326634b6b","d669e065-ebc5-4ead-aa6e-45048a31ea9d","ce09c580-c861-4155-992f-20eeed986b66"],"optionImageIds":["9fd014f1-b368-4885-95d2-d8eaa6d5dc38","aacbacf5-3a3c-4f0a-b5da-4b82d1b91d7f","5c70e04d-0a89-4f51-82fe-451c99925b22"],"ending":-1}
