{"id":307,"name":"The Final Showdown","paragraphs":["You swing the metal pipe with all your might, aiming for the creature's head. It dodges out of the way at the last second and lunges towards you, but you manage to sidestep it. You're locked in a deadly dance with the creature, both of you trying to gain the upper hand.","Just when you think you've got the creature on the ropes, it manages to land a solid blow to your side. You stagger backwards, gasping for air, but you don't give up. You rally your strength and charge at the creature again, swinging the metal pipe like a madman.","Finally, after what seems like an eternity, the creature crumples to the ground, defeated. You stand there panting, adrenaline coursing through your veins, as you survey the scene around you. The hospital is silent now, except for the sound of rain tapping against the pavement outside.","You realize that you've been through one hell of an adventure tonight. You're not sure if you'll ever be the same again. But one thing's for certain: you're definitely going to be more careful about your late-night explorations from now on."],"imageIds":["6c1b0939-6fbf-4502-8f46-9e8f177909ea","a930ddad-8fe5-438f-aa95-7c3ac34747ea","2d1fccbd-316a-40e3-99b2-6d9603d315e4","4aefac29-51e6-494e-b153-486e912d500a"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":122}
