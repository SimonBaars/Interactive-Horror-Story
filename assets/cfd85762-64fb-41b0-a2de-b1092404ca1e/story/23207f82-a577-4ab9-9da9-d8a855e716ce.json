To your surprise, they start to move along with you, their lurching and shuffling taking on a strange rhythm of its own. You keep dancing, your moves getting more and more complex as the creatures follow your lead.","As the dance-off reaches its climax, you pull out your secret weapon - the moonwalk. The creatures stop moving for a moment, watching you in confusion. Then, one of them starts to mimic your moves, gliding backwards across the floor just like you. You smile, knowing that victory is within your grasp.","Suddenly, the lights flicker back on, illuminating the room. You see that the creatures were actually just maintenance workers in Halloween costumes. You all burst out laughing, relieved that the whole thing was just a misunderstanding.","Your parent walks up to you, grateful that you're both safe. \"I don't know how you did it,\" they say, \"but you managed to dance your way out of that mess.\" You grin, secretly pleased with yourself, knowing that it was all thanks to your love of a certain classic movie."],"imageIds":["3c6e973c-f811-43e0-bd30-20abf4b1491b","82e786f0-d8e0-478f-8640-e4128e034608","c05bb903-c4b2-4c39-81df-4632b304d098","f9ca009e-d678-4cce-8a6e-00130b65f452"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":146}
