{"id":442,"name":"The Family Secret","paragraphs":["You confront your family about their ties to the cult and demand that they tell you everything. At first, they are hesitant to speak, but eventually, they reveal a shocking secret that has been hidden from you for years. Your family has been part of this cult for generations, and they believe that it gives them special powers and privileges. They had planned to initiate you into the cult when you turned 25, but the recent events at the hospital made them doubt their decision.","You are horrified by what you've just learned and can't believe that your family has been keeping this secret from you all these years. You realize that you have a difficult decision to make. Should you cut ties with your family and report the cult to the authorities, or should you try to convince them to leave the cult and renounce their beliefs? As you ponder your next move, you notice that one of the symbols on the wall behind your family looks familiar. It's the same symbol that you saw in the ritual chamber at the hospital."],"imageIds":["25922e93-55db-41e3-b20a-08a7cc2d4083","0325b967-6864-497d-88a0-ed2c73d5644f"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":237}
