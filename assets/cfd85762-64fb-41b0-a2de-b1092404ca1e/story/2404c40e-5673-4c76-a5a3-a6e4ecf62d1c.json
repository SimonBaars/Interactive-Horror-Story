{"id":178,"name":"The Gown Gambit","paragraphs":["You wrap your hospital gown around your head like a ninja mask and make your way through the hallways, trying to avoid being seen. As you turn a corner, you bump into someone in a white coat. It's not a doctor or a nurse but a fellow patient who is also trying to escape. They tell you that they've figured out what's going on - the hospital has been taken over by aliens.","At first, you don't believe them, but then you look around and notice that something is off. There are strange symbols etched into the walls, and the lights flicker in an unnatural pattern. Your new friend tells you that there's a spaceship waiting on the roof to take them away, and invites you to come along. With no other options, you agree, and the two of you sneak up to the roof. Sure enough, there's a sleek spacecraft hovering above, waiting to whisk you away to another world."],"imageIds":["9be72e30-333e-4d12-b09b-880f5ec368b4","85a10e4f-1bcb-4cdf-8df0-f21d5cb4a93f"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":6}
