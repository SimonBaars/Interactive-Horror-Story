{"id":309,"name":"The Negotiation","paragraphs":["You try to reason with the creature again, but it seems more interested in dragging you back towards the hospital entrance than listening to what you have to say. Suddenly, you hear a loud explosion from somewhere deeper inside the hospital. The creature stops in its tracks and looks around, seeming confused.","You take advantage of the distraction and pull your arm free from the creature's grip. It snarls at you, but before it can attack, a group of people come running out of the hospital. They're wearing hazmat suits and carrying strange-looking weapons. \"Get down!\" one of them yells, and you drop to the ground just as they start firing at the creature.","In the chaos, you manage to scramble to your feet and run towards your car. As you drive away, you see more explosions and hear gunshots coming from the hospital. You don't know what's going on, but it's clear that things have gotten much worse than you thought. You make a mental note to stay far away from hospitals in the future."],"imageIds":["bf6899bc-107d-4b7b-a968-0a89e2063754","da0ac798-4d12-4d42-a310-585eabadcce6","6c18b282-29bc-422c-b1c8-e08d483f724a"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":124}
