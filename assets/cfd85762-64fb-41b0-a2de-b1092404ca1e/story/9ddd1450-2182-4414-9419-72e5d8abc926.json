As you belt out the lyrics to \"Don't Stop Believing,\" you can't help but feel a sense of joy and relief. It seems like the chaos and terror of the past few hours have finally been left behind.","Suddenly, the car screeches to a halt as something appears in front of it. You look out of the window and see a strange, glowing portal. The police officer gets out of the car and tries to investigate, but he's pulled into the portal by an unseen force.","You're left alone in the car, feeling confused and terrified. Then, a voice speaks to you from the radio. It's the same whispering voice that you heard in the dark room earlier. It tells you that you've been chosen for a special task and that you must enter the portal if you want to save the world.","You take a deep breath and step out of the car. You walk towards the portal, feeling a sense of dread and anticipation. As you step through the shimmering gateway, you wonder what lies ahead and what kind of challenges you'll face. But one thing is certain - you're ready for whatever comes your way."],"imageIds":["313e7af9-9b10-4c70-865b-f3b6c5db360e","1f8aa454-3d95-4de6-b5d8-31b1a9c55d09","ed0a7137-0ee5-4db7-acab-4d013cba70b0","b4a6dad2-e6a9-4077-ba6f-ddc9549f82b5"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":241}
