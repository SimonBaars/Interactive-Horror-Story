As you walk, the sound gets louder and louder until you come to a door. You slowly push it open and step out into bright sunlight. You're outside! You look around and realize that you're in a park, surrounded by trees and greenery. A group of people are playing frisbee nearby, completely unaware of the danger that you've just escaped.","As you take a deep breath of fresh air, you realize that you made it out alive. You survived the horrors of the hospital and emerged on the other side with a new appreciation for life.
