As you sprint down the hallway, you hear the creatures chasing after you, their guttural snarls echoing through the corridors. You burst out of the hospital doors and run into the pouring rain, frantically dialing the emergency number on your phone. Gasping for breath, you tell the operator what you've seen and plead for them to send backup.","A few minutes later, you see the flashing lights of several police cars approaching in the distance. You slump to the ground, tears streaming down your face, overwhelmed with emotion. The police officers jump out of their vehicles and rush towards you, asking what happened. You manage to explain the situation between gasps, and they quickly head inside the hospital with guns drawn.","As you wait outside, you're wracked with guilt and despair. You wish you had done more to help your parent and that you could have saved them from the creatures' grasp. Eventually, the police emerge from the hospital, informing you that the creatures have been taken care of, but your parent didn't make it. You collapse to the ground, sobbing uncontrollably, as the reality of the situation hits you."],"imageIds":["9d6fa0ca-6c4e-437a-9144-dda86074aae7","8c84c3ad-7f49-406e-a036-39e212c0be69","0abf65fa-80ac-42f7-854d-8954b379e8ce"],"optionNames":["Seek revenge","Try to move on","Turn yourself in to the police"],"optionDescriptions":["You decide to seek revenge on the creatures that killed your parent.","You decide to try and move on from the tragic events.","You decide to turn yourself in to the police for your involvement with the creatures."],"optionIds":["3bc5b679-63da-4986-a462-3f5149eef9dd","6b4d410f-3aa9-4b52-a1ac-908575b39a16"],"optionImageIds":["38e5414a-4ffc-4a82-a897-827be242076e","4f418d76-bf8f-439a-8387-4237e7eb3fbe","d8f01ae3-f53f-4d69-a648-a9fd78f7da79"],"ending":-1}
