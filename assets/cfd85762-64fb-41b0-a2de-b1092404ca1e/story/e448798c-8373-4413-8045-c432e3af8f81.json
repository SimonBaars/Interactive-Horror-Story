With each passing moment, your parent's condition worsens, and you know that time is running out. But finally, you arrive at their bedside, antidote in hand.","Without hesitation, you administer the antidote to your parent, hoping against hope that it will work. For a few tense moments, nothing seems to happen. But then, miraculously, your parent begins to stir. They look up at you, their eyes filled with gratitude and love. \"Thank you,\" they whisper weakly.","You spend the next few hours by your parent's side, watching over them and making sure they're comfortable. It's clear that they're not out of the woods yet, but there's a glimmer of hope in the air. You feel a sense of relief wash over you as you realize that, against all odds, you managed to save them.","As you sit there, lost in thought, something catches your eye. It's a small, shiny object lying on the ground near the bed. You pick it up, curious. And as you examine it more closely, you realize that it's a strange, otherworldly artifact.
