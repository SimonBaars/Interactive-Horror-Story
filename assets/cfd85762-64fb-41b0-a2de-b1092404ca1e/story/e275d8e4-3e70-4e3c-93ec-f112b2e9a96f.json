{"id":286,"name":"The Accidental Savior","paragraphs":["You check your phone and see that you accidentally butt-dialed an old friend during the confrontation with the cultists. They left you a message, asking if you were okay and explaining how they had been trying to reach out to you for months. Overcome with emotion, you start crying and realize that you've been so caught up in your own problems that you forgot about the people who care about you.","As you wipe away your tears, you notice that the cultists are nowhere to be seen. You quickly realize that your accidental butt-dial somehow disrupted the ritual and saved your parent's life. You embrace your parent, feeling grateful and relieved that everything turned out okay. From now on, you vow to stay connected with your loved ones and never take them for granted again."],"imageIds":["93e91422-8661-4dbf-bd09-433dd358caae","9af63592-b75f-4c29-896b-03e4167136c3"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":103}
