But every time you see a hospital or hear a siren, your heart skips a beat. You start avoiding sick people and refuse to watch medical dramas on TV. You even stop using band-aids and start using duct tape instead.","One day, you're waiting in line at the grocery store when you hear someone talking about the secret organization that was behind the hospital incident. You involuntarily perk up and start listening intently. But as it turns out, the person is just talking about the Illuminati's involvement in pop culture. You feel stupid for getting your hopes up and silently curse yourself.","You try to distract yourself with hobbies and activities, but nothing seems to work. You even start playing video games and find yourself drawn to games that involve hospitals and medical emergencies. You start playing \"Surgeon Simulator\" and fantasize about performing life-saving surgeries.","Eventually, you come to terms with the fact that some things are just beyond your control. You realize that you don't need to have all the answers and that it's okay to not know everything. You start living your life without the weight of the hospital incident on your shoulders and eventually find peace."],"imageIds":["2f891d40-4895-4d51-913c-ad91fe8da806","46714a6c-19c2-45a4-a449-a49d4594ebae","0d1c2fc9-6793-44f3-8916-1fa4b8c3bf9d","1d09e155-e419-419c-8a13-93a61cc214e5"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":236}
