{"id":225,"name":"The Game","paragraphs":["You set up the chessboard, and the figure sits opposite you. As the game begins, you feel a sense of unease. The figure seems to be several moves ahead of you, anticipating your every move. You start to worry that this was a mistake.","Suddenly, the figure makes a mistake, leaving its king exposed. You see an opportunity and take it, capturing the figure's king with your bishop. The figure lets out a screech of rage, and everything goes dark.","When you open your eyes again, you find yourself back in your own bed, safe and sound. You wonder if it was all just a dream, but then you notice that you're holding a small wooden chess piece in your hand. You shudder, not wanting to think about what might have happened if you had lost the game.","You decide to put the chess piece away and try to forget about the strange events of the night before. But as the days go by, you can't shake the feeling that something isn't quite right. Every time you look at the chess piece, you feel a pang of fear in your chest. You start to wonder if the figure will come back, and if you'll be ready for it if it does."],"imageIds":["8c171b96-5ebb-4445-919c-becc9c95412d","c383f209-30ae-48f9-9f17-449a34632238","add6b017-6c5f-4dce-9982-7b69d854f878","fec33eb3-3d7a-4cd5-af4a-b1d7b3417245"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":48}
