{"id":305,"name":"The Return","paragraphs":["You return to the hospital during the day, hoping to find some answers. As you walk through the empty hallways, you can't help but feel a sense of dread creeping up on you. Everything looks different in the daylight, and it's even more eerie than it was before.","You explore several floors of the hospital, but you don't find anything out of the ordinary. Just as you're about to give up and go home, you notice a small door tucked away in a corner. It's partially open, and you can see a faint light coming from inside.","You push open the door and step inside, and what you see makes your blood run cold. The room is filled with strange equipment and experiments, and there are notes and drawings scattered everywhere. You realize that this isn't just a hospital -- it's a laboratory where unspeakable things were done to people. You feel sick to your stomach as you realize the full extent of what happened here, and you know that you'll never be able to forget it."],"imageIds":["75cea92f-b8f2-412c-b729-55c05a602019","731ba79e-7f6d-4f93-8697-dbff9d49f397","277f475a-971a-4765-a36f-d05549c37a6b"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":120}
