You have been training all this time to become our vessel, to host the spirit of our leader and allow him to conquer this world.\" Your heart sinks as the truth dawns on you – you were never chosen for greatness, but for sacrifice.","The creatures around you start to advance, their true intentions exposed. You try to fight them off, but there are too many. Just when it seems like all hope is lost, an unexpected ally shows up – the nurse from earlier. She wields a weapon made out of medical supplies and fights fiercely alongside you.","Together, you manage to hold off the creatures long enough to make a run for it. As you're running down the hallway, you see something that catches your eye – a painting of your ancestor, who was also rumored to have possessed unusual powers. Suddenly, it clicks – the creatures had mistaken you for your ancestor and were trying to use you to bring back their leader.","With newfound determination, you vow to take down the creatures once and for all and prevent them from ever hurting anyone again. You and the nurse fight your way through the hospital, taking down every creature in your path. Finally, you emerge victorious, but bruised and battered. As you exit the hospital, you notice the sun rising in the distance – a symbol of hope and new beginnings."],"imageIds":["0c35cb1d-1722-48bc-b304-106176bd2c1f","203719ca-8afc-490c-ab98-7f590fd4de1b","49110084-5a63-4aa3-ac31-97226f910b51","2fd1afa6-8d86-400a-86cf-faf927d4391e"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":251}
