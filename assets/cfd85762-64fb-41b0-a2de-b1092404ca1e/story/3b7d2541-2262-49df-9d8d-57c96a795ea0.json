As it approaches, you take a deep breath and send a blast of energy towards it. The creature recoils from the force of the blast, but it doesn't go down. Instead, it lunges at you once again, its eyes burning with renewed fury.","You brace yourself for the impact, but just as the creature is about to strike, you hear the sound of police sirens in the distance. The creature hesitates for a moment, seemingly unsure of what to do, and that's when you see your chance. With all the strength you can muster, you launch another blast of energy at it. This time, it works. The creature disintegrates into nothingness, leaving you standing alone on the deserted road. You look up and see the flashing lights of a police car approaching, and you realize that you're going to be okay."],"imageIds":["1389b422-698c-4962-98b2-8f2c92087f20","1293a5a6-d513-4bb7-a63b-7d28e7d43826"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":17}
