The experiments have caused irreversible damage, and your parent doesn't have much time left. You refuse to accept their answer and start looking around the laboratory for anything that can help.","Suddenly, you spot a vial of glowing liquid on one of the shelves. It looks familiar, and then you remember where you've seen it before â€“ in your parent's room at the hospital. They told you that it was a medicine that could cure any illness, but the hospital refused to use it because it was experimental.","You grab the vial and rush over to your parent's side. You inject them with the liquid, and within seconds, you see a change. Their breathing becomes more regular, and the glow around them starts to fade. You smile with relief and realize that you've saved your parent's life.
