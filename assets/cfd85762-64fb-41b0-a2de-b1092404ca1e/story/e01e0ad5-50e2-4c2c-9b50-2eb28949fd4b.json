At first, it's difficult to adjust to your new life, but you eventually find your footing. You volunteer at a local hospital, hoping to give back after the mistakes you made in the past.","One day, while volunteering, you come across a patient who reminds you of your parent. You sit with them and listen to their stories, feeling a sense of purpose that you haven't felt in a long time. As you leave the hospital that day, you realize that you've finally found your calling.","You enroll in nursing school and work tirelessly to earn your degree. Upon graduation, you're hired by the hospital where you volunteered, and you become one of the most trusted nurses on staff. Though you can never erase the mistakes of your past, you find comfort in knowing that you're doing everything you can to make up for them."],"imageIds":["4fd90e71-4144-4682-872a-c868da6daac1","96056a1d-1307-4d6f-ae2b-ade5ca02e243","2e34a8ba-5724-401c-8374-079110490d9b"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":157}
