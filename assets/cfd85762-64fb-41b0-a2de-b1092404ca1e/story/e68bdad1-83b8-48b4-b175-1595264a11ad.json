{"id":329,"name":"The Escape","paragraphs":["You turn and run towards the exit, hoping to find a way out of the hospital. As you round a corner, you run smack into another person. You both fall to the ground, but as you scramble to your feet, you realize that this is no ordinary person. They're dressed in strange robes, and their eyes are glowing a bright green.","The figure raises its hand and mutters something under its breath, and suddenly the hallway is filled with a thick fog. You can hear the creatures moving around somewhere in the mist, but you can't see them. You start to panic, wondering how you'll ever get out of here alive.","Just when you think all hope is lost, you spot an exit sign through the fog. You start running towards it as fast as you can, dodging around the creatures as they lurch out of the mist. Finally, you burst through the door and into the fresh air outside, gasping for breath and thanking whatever gods might be listening.","You look back at the hospital and see strange figures moving behind the windows. You're not sure what kind of nightmare you've stumbled into, but you know one thing for sure: you never want to come back here again."],"imageIds":["bf44907a-9f11-4802-a8b0-444188778e51","2205c912-bf10-4e26-b45d-a44ccb8cc70e","633506af-1421-4d59-896c-c4cb5d28be79","9bee1fec-3796-477d-8f4d-fe8ea6bb1ea9"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":143}
