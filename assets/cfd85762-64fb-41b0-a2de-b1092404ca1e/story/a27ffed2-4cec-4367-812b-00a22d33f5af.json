Before long, you're all dabbing together, laughing and having a great time. You can't believe that just a few minutes ago, you were running for your life from these very same creatures.","As you continue to dance with the creatures, you start to notice something strange happening. They're slowly starting to change before your eyes, their features becoming less monstrous and more human-like.
