You hear the group of people shouting and running after you, their footsteps echoing through the empty halls. You don't know what they want with you, but you know that you need to get out of there before they catch you.","You keep running until you see a bright light up ahead. As you get closer, you realize that it's the exit! You burst out of the hospital doors and into the cool night air, gasping for breath. You look back at the hospital and see shadows moving in the windows, but you know that you're safe now.","As you walk away from the hospital, you realize that you've been changed by this experience. You've seen things that you never thought were possible, and you know that you'll never be the same again. But you also know that you survived, and that's something to be proud of."],"imageIds":["bd3cc50c-b656-4327-a802-03dcc7f32368","a71b42b4-3f77-4d21-9bdf-e7ef723c8534","70fbf7c8-22fb-429a-8450-52f771c63b23"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":133}
