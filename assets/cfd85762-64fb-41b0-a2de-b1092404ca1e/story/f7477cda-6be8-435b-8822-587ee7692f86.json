Suddenly, you hear a voice behind you. It's your parent, standing free and unharmed. They explain that they were able to escape from the cultists' grasp while you were negotiating with them. They knew that you would never let them be sacrificed and decided to take matters into their own hands.","The ground begins to shake, and you realize that the ancient evil is about to be unleashed. You grab your parent's hand and prepare for the worst. But then, something unexpected happens. The symbols on your parent's forehead start to glow, and a bright light envelops you both. When you open your eyes, you find yourself standing in your parent's bedroom, just like before.","You look around, confused and disoriented. Your parent explains that they've been studying ancient magic for years, and that they were trying to use it to stop the cultists. They thought that they had failed, but it seems that their efforts were not in vain. As you hug each other, grateful to be alive, you realize that things will never be the same again. You've seen things that can't be unseen, and you've learned that the world is a far scarier place than you ever imagined."],"imageIds":["48c18a77-a482-4061-9708-72c12f8b0d98","8b712d17-714f-45ec-9fb6-d295e33e189c","24e25fa1-54ee-4caa-85ea-1bde5fea97b5"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":215}
