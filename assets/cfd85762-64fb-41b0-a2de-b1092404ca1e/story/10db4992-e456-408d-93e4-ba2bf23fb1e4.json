{"id":394,"name":"The Antidote Hunt","paragraphs":["You and the nurse make your way to the research lab where the antidote is being kept. As you search through the shelves, the nurse apologizes for their role in the disaster. \"I guess you could say I'm not the best at my job,\" they say with a nervous laugh. \"But hey, at least it's never boring around here!\"","After what seems like hours of searching, you finally find the antidote. You quickly administer it to yourself and feel the effects almost immediately. The pain recedes, and you feel stronger and more alert than ever before. \"Well, that was a wild ride,\" you say to the nurse with a grin. \"I don't know about you, but I think I've had enough excitement for one day!\"","As you make your way out of the hospital, you can't help but feel grateful that you made it out alive. \"I couldn't have done it without you,\" you say to the nurse, clapping them on the back. \"Despite everything, I'm glad we were able to work together.\" The nurse nods and smiles. \"Yeah, me too. Maybe next time we'll try something a little less dangerous, eh?\"","As you drive away from the hospital, you can't help but reflect on the day's events. It was a crazy, terrifying experience, but it taught you that you're capable of more than you ever thought possible. And who knows? Maybe you'll even go back to visit the nurse one day. After all, as they say, \"life is an adventure!\""],"imageIds":["3b4992ec-0bfb-4f7c-b3f1-95e327049f33","c829521e-f27e-436d-9e31-f5a083c1603e","c9e409a8-efbc-4883-9a7e-7a89356d53db","5da40490-17b5-401f-a226-b0ce0cd447cf"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":197}
