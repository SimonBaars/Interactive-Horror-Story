As you savor each bite, you reflect on your life and the memories that brought you joy. You're surrounded by loved ones, who share stories and laughter with you into the night.","Despite the looming sense of sadness, you feel a great sense of peace as you finish your meal. You know that your time is almost up, but you're grateful for the moments that you have left. Your loved ones say their goodbyes, and you drift off to sleep.","When you wake up, you find that you're no longer in your hospital bed. Instead, you're standing in a bright, sunny field, surrounded by rolling hills and a gentle breeze. You feel lighter than air, free from pain or discomfort. You realize that this is what true peace feels like.","You take one last look at the world that you're leaving behind and smile. You're ready for whatever comes next, knowing that your legacy lives on through the people that you touched in life.
