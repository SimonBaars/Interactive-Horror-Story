You quickly gather as much of it as you can and head outside, where you see the creatures rampaging through the streets. With the help of your companion, you manage to inject as many creatures as possible, watching as they fall to the ground, lifeless.","As the sun rises over the city, you and your companion survey the destruction left behind by the outbreak.
