{"id":227,"name":"The Escape","paragraphs":["You manage to break free of the restraints and fight back against the figure. It's a fierce battle, but you're determined to escape. Just as you think you have the upper hand, the figure disappears in a puff of smoke.","You look around, trying to get your bearings. You realize that you're in a laboratory, and there are strange machines and equipment all around you. As you start to explore, you hear footsteps coming from down the hallway.","You duck behind a nearby table and watch as a group of people wearing white coats enter the room. They seem to be searching for something, and one of them is holding a small vial of liquid. You can't make out what they're saying, but you sense that they're up to no good.","You wait until the coast is clear before making your escape. You run down the hallway and burst through the door at the end. You find yourself outside, standing in the middle of a deserted street. You don't know where to go or what to do, but you know that you can never go back to that hospital again."],"imageIds":["2f9ea4fb-5b3a-43cd-86d0-38f15fbad014","a35d1b81-cc9e-4d39-bcba-9e3dce2c2542","1dcf460a-73b0-4a08-9572-07580d457663","6a68b332-d60f-4d02-9af6-52cfed81a0d7"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":50}
