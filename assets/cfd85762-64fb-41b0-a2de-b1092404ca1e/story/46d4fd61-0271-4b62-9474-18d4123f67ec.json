{"id":518,"name":"The Consequence","paragraphs":["You roast one of the creatures over a fire and take a bite. The taste is unlike anything you've ever experienced - it's gamey, tough, and bitter all at once. As you eat more, you begin to feel strange sensations in your body. Your heart races, your muscles tense up, and your mind becomes foggy.","Suddenly, everything goes black, and you lose consciousness. When you wake up, you find yourself surrounded by a group of people. They're all staring at you with a mix of fear and curiosity. One of them steps forward and introduces themselves as a doctor. They explain that you've been in a coma for weeks and that they found you lying in the middle of the street, covered in strange markings.","The doctor tells you that they've never seen anything like the marks on your skin before. They seem to be some kind of virus or infection, but they don't know what caused it. They also mention that there have been reports of similar outbreaks all around the world, leading to chaos and destruction on a global scale. The reality of what you've done hits you like a ton of bricks, and you feel overwhelmed with guilt and despair.","As you contemplate the consequences of your actions, you realize that the world will never be the same again. The creatures you ate were carriers of a deadly virus, and now you've become infected. You know that your time is running out, but you also know that you have to make things right before it's too late. You vow to devote the rest of your life to finding a cure for the virus, hoping that someday you can make amends for the terrible mistake you made."],"imageIds":["7ff81a33-5be3-4c8f-9ed1-4f4dd1d9376f","573df5b7-42b2-4a57-acf2-8063b88d9fec","e507950c-663c-411e-9b7e-91bd9c5f0800","493956da-692a-4147-8a47-7f79685e856c"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":305}
