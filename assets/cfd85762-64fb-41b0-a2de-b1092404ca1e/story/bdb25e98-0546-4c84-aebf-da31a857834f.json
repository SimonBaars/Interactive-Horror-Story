{"id":371,"name":"Waiting for Help","paragraphs":["You and your parent sit in the corner of the room, waiting for help. The injured girl is lying on a makeshift bed nearby, moaning softly. The police officer is pacing back and forth, looking anxious. Suddenly, you hear a loud banging on the door.","The police officer pulls out his gun and cautiously approaches the door. He looks through the peephole and then relaxes visibly. \"It's okay,\" he says, opening the door. \"It's just a delivery guy.\" You're relieved that it's not one of the creatures, but you can't shake the feeling that something isn't right.","The delivery guy hands the police officer a package and hurries away without saying anything. The police officer opens the package, and inside, he finds a strange device with a note attached to it. \"Use this to destroy the creatures,\" the note reads. The police officer looks at you and your parent, a glimmer of hope in his eyes.","With trembling hands, the police officer activates the device, and suddenly, the creatures start disappearing one by one. You and your parent hug each other tightly, overjoyed that the nightmare is finally over. As you walk out of the police station, you see a man standing across the street, watching you with a strange expression on his face. You don't recognize him, but you have a feeling that he knows more than he's letting on."],"imageIds":["a867a2ea-ea55-4886-8df1-17922a3ab489","86e205ff-fa69-4f3c-ba60-145372359ea0","786d8009-8f70-4a64-b07d-40d6c40ce86a","7c0c1492-d47d-4686-b393-54650fdc5afe"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":176}
