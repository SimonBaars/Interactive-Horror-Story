You're not exactly sure what creatures like to eat, but you figure that everyone likes a good burger. You start grilling up some burgers, and the creatures seem intrigued.","As you work, you notice that the creatures are also cooking up their own food. It's a strange mix of meats and vegetables that you've never seen before, but it actually smells pretty good. You decide to try some, and it's surprisingly delicious.","After a few hours of cooking, you and the creatures sit down to try each other's food.
