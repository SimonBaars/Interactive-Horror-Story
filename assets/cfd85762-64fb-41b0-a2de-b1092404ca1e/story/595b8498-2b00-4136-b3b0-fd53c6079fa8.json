{"id":325,"name":"The Final Run","paragraphs":["Your heart is pounding in your chest as you run towards the light, the sound of your footsteps echoing loudly through the silent hospital halls. You're nearly there when you hear a low growl from behind you, and you realize that one of the creatures has caught up to you.","You turn and face the creature, but it's unlike anything you've ever seen before. Its eyes glow red in the darkness, and its skin ripples and shifts like liquid metal. You try to dodge out of the way as it lunges at you, but it's too fast.","Just as you think all is lost, you see a glimmer of something on the creature's neck: a small key. You reach out and grab it, not knowing what it's for but hoping that it will help you escape.","You keep running towards the light, not daring to look back until you're safely out of the hospital. As you step out into the sunlight, you feel a wave of relief wash over you. You don't know what happened in there or where those creatures came from, but you do know one thing: you'll never forget this day."],"imageIds":["fe97c901-c747-4a64-8be8-536aaefe8f64","6662915d-3baf-4bc9-a51b-84cd3932368d","cfeb28a4-5e89-4dd6-ac03-be41a068394a","f7fccf05-0796-4615-9ea6-fd59d2555c07"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":140}
