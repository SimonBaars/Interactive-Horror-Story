{"id":233,"name":"The Symbol","paragraphs":["As you kneel down to get a closer look at the symbol, a sudden gust of wind knocks you off balance. You stumble backwards, and your head hits the pavement hard. When you come to, you're lying in a hospital bed with a bandage on your head. A nurse informs you that you were found unconscious near the entrance.","You ask about the strange symbol you saw, but the nurse just shakes her head and says she doesn't know anything about it. You realize that you're not going to get any answers here and decide to leave. As you make your way out of the hospital, you can't shake the feeling that something isn't right.","As you step outside, you see the same figure from before standing across the street, watching you. It slowly disappears into thin air as you watch in shock. You may never know what really happened at St. Mary's Hospital, but one thing is for sure - you'll never forget the nightmare you experienced there."],"imageIds":["91bf99c9-a1c0-4091-afb6-df2d240df9ca","8b00d556-3273-4539-961a-5aaf8d3dbd31","87d29ed1-1a95-4984-8dee-5fb081da4673"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":55}
