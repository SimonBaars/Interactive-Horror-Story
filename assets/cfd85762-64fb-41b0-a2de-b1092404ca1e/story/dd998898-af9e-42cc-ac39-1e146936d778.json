{"id":317,"name":"The Escape","paragraphs":["You tiptoe past the group of people, trying not to make a sound. As you make your way down the hallway, you notice strange markings etched into the walls and floors. They look like some kind of ancient symbols or runes.","You start to feel like you're being watched, and you turn around quickly, but there's no one there. You keep moving forward until you come to a dead end. There's nowhere else to go.","Just as you're about to give up hope, you notice something strange about the wall in front of you. There's a small seam running down the center of it. You push on it gently, and to your surprise, the wall slides away, revealing a narrow staircase leading down.","You take a deep breath and descend the stairs, unsure of what you'll find at the bottom. When you reach the bottom, you find yourself in a dimly lit room filled with strange artifacts and objects. In the center of the room, there's an old book lying open on a pedestal. You step forward to examine it, but just as you do, you hear footsteps approaching from behind you."],"imageIds":["25c02664-c828-488b-89d1-45ca33f409a4","fc7a3125-c57b-47ad-b289-399b8d48b384","4f86f501-3c48-408c-a045-0b05cf37920e","add66668-4919-4cfc-b26a-71a3ab52f409"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":132}
