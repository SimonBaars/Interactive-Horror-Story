{"id":196,"name":"The Surrender","paragraphs":["You slowly lower your hands and turn around to face the unknown speaker. In the dim light, you can see that it's a security guard, his uniform rumpled and stained with sweat. He looks just as surprised to see you as you are to see him.","\"What are you doing here?\" he demands, his voice low and menacing. \"This building is off-limits to the public.\" You try to explain what happened back at the hospital, but he doesn't seem to believe you. Instead, he radios for backup and orders you to turn around and put your hands behind your back.","As the guard leads you away, you notice something strange. The small, glowing object that the old woman was holding is now in his pocket. You start to ask him about it, but he cuts you off, telling you to be quiet. You're not sure what's going on, but you have a feeling that things are about to get even more complicated."],"imageIds":["7be7a0c7-1e24-4384-929c-61d0d866aa7a","c48893a0-2030-408d-8d41-5c5d0f2465b9","30bcc99d-3e6e-4f24-8c1b-2ec8ab2019b6"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":21}
