{"id":247,"name":"The Final Confrontation","paragraphs":["As you slowly open the door, you are startled to find a group of people in white coats standing outside. They rush into the room, and quickly subdue the figure from before. One of them turns to you and says \"we've been looking for you.\"","You're confused about who they are and what's going on, but they don't seem to be hostile. They explain that they work for an organization that investigates paranormal activity, and they've been tracking the figure for some time now. They also reveal that your parent was part of their organization, and they were investigating the same case when they got sick.","They offer to take you with them so you can help solve the mystery, but they warn you that it won't be easy. The figure was just one small part of a much larger problem, and they need all the help they can get. You accept their offer and leave the hospital with them, ready to face whatever comes next."],"imageIds":["1d1c1bb2-b1df-429c-9375-1b1857099eaf","fc12ec7b-5d16-48d1-885d-9d2021bd7f86","41959a8f-045e-4f34-8786-5bed7c867f7e"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":68}
