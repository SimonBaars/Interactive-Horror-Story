{"id":184,"name":"The Escape Plan","paragraphs":["You search the cell for any hidden clues that might help you escape. After a few minutes, you notice a loose brick in the wall. You pry it out with your fingers and find a small key hidden inside. It's rusty and old, but it might still work.","You try the key in the cell door, and to your surprise, it turns. The door creaks open, revealing a dimly-lit hallway. You step through the doorway, trying to be as quiet as possible. As you walk down the hallway, you hear the sound of footsteps echoing in the distance.","You follow the footsteps until you come to a staircase leading up. You climb the stairs, taking them two at a time. When you reach the top, you find yourself in a lobby area. There's a security guard stationed at the front desk, but they don't seem to have noticed you yet.","You make a run for the exit, sprinting past the guard and out into the night. You keep running until you're sure you're far enough away from the building. When you finally stop, you take a deep breath and look back at the hospital. You wonder what other secrets it holds, but you know that you never want to go back there again."],"imageIds":["a8a25002-c44a-4dd1-a81d-8a759635bf52","c3f1b5d2-c06d-4d36-8aed-1c45897cb2d6","4e2b4aae-86ef-4102-9a6f-4e4e9c853cde","b818deb1-cc74-44a6-ab28-89fb84d4b851"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":10}
