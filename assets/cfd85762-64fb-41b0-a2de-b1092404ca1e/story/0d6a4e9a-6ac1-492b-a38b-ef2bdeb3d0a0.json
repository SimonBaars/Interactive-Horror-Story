{"id":391,"name":"The Final Revelation","paragraphs":["You follow the symbols deeper and deeper into the hospital, feeling like you're getting closer to the truth. But as you turn a corner, you come face to face with a group of hooded figures, chanting in a language that you've never heard before. They don't seem to notice you at first, so you start to back away slowly, hoping that you can escape unnoticed. But just as you think you're in the clear, one of the figures turns towards you and points directly at you, calling out to the rest of the group.","Suddenly, the entire group starts racing towards you, closing in on you from all sides. You try to run, but they're too fast, grabbing at you with their bony fingers. Just when you think it's the end for you, a brilliant flash of light fills the hallway, blinding you and the hooded figures. When your vision clears, you see that you're standing outside of the hospital, surrounded by a team of police officers and emergency personnel. When they see you, they rush over to you, asking if you're okay. You nod weakly, still in shock from everything that's happened. It's a miracle that you made it out alive."],"imageIds":["dec40818-05e1-4d5e-943f-27ba48e84865","d32b98f2-cc07-45b2-a1d7-36447322c4e6"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":194}
