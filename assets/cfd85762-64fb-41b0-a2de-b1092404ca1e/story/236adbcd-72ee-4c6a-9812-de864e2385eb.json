After a while, you start to think that there might not be anything else to find. But then, you notice a small, barely visible dot on the screen. You try clicking on it, and to your surprise, a new message appears.","The message is cryptic, with strange symbols and incomprehensible text. But something about it draws you in, and you feel compelled to decipher its meaning. You spend hours poring over the message, trying to make sense of it all.","And finally, after what feels like an eternity, you crack the code. The message is a map, leading to a secret room in the hospital that you didn't know existed. Without hesitation, you grab your things and set out to find the room.","As you enter the room, you feel a sense of unease. It's cramped and coated in dust, with strange symbols etched into the walls.
