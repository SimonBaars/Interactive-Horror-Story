{"id":219,"name":"The Overreaction","paragraphs":["You smash the computer in a fit of rage, venting your frustration at falling for the simulation. But then you realize that you just destroyed an expensive piece of equipment that wasn't even yours. You look around sheepishly and see that everyone else in the room is staring at you in disbelief. One of them says, \"Dude, it was just a game.\" You try to make a joke to diffuse the tension but end up making things even more awkward.","As you leave the building, still red-faced from embarrassment, you hear a voice behind you. It's the game designer! She tells you that your overreaction was exactly what they were hoping for â€“ they needed someone to test the limits of the simulation's realism. They offer you a job as a game tester, and you suddenly realize that your moment of stupidity has turned into an opportunity. You laugh to yourself, thinking that sometimes the best way to succeed is to fail spectacularly."],"imageIds":["93644608-8333-4edb-970c-51f8578e171e","1326e6ad-e31d-4afe-a00d-cd75b085a15d"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":43}
