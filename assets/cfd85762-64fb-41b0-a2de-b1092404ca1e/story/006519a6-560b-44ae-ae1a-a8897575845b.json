{"id":300,"name":"The Fall","paragraphs":["You take a deep breath and jump off the cliff, your arms outstretched like wings. For a few seconds, you feel weightless, as if you're really flying. But then gravity takes hold, and you begin to fall.","You try to remember all the superhero movies you've seen and how they managed to fly. But you can't seem to recall anything useful. You flail your arms and legs, desperately trying to stay aloft, but it's no use.","As you near the ground, you realize that this is the end. You close your eyes and brace yourself for impact. But instead of hitting the ground, you feel something soft beneath you. You open your eyes and see that you're lying on a giant trampoline.","You bounce up into the air, higher and higher, until you're soaring above the clouds. You laugh with joy, feeling as free as a bird. You realize that you don't need superpowers to be a hero; all you need is the courage to take a leap of faith."],"imageIds":["05193fc1-d069-43e5-9cab-14786c4c0e0b","a58c4f0e-3111-44a9-ab90-34e33ae6c872","c14a2dbc-dffc-4f67-9c89-8fb6a3a7237f","23d1505e-338d-4b57-a2b7-ebc482b95888"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":115}
