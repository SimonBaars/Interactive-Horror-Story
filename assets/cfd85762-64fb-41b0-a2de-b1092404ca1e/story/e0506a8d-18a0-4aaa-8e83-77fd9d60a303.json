{"id":515,"name":"The Final Stand","paragraphs":["You grab a broomstick and swing at the creature, catching it off guard. It staggers back, giving you enough time to grab a lamp and smash it over its head. More creatures start pouring into your house, but you're not going down without a fight.","You grab whatever you can find - plates, chairs, even the TV remote - and use them as weapons. You're surprised at how strong you feel, fueled by the adrenaline of the battle. However, you know that you can't keep this up forever.","Just when it seems like all is lost, the police arrive and start fighting alongside you. Together, you manage to drive the creatures out of your house and into the streets. It's a long and brutal battle, but in the end, you emerge victorious.","As the dust settles, you realize that this isn't over yet. There are still more creatures out there, and they're growing stronger every day. You vow to keep fighting, to protect yourself and those you love from the growing threat."],"imageIds":["d11b90f7-622f-47db-939b-54726bca35ce","880cb996-6b08-49ce-8931-0eb05d420afa","a2d0cb77-a4b4-405a-bd2c-593b6b1c1ab2","ede4249a-be78-4de1-942a-4bb7e262836e"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":302}
