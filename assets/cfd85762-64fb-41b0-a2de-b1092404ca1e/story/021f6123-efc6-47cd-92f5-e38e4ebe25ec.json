You're not sure what they could do in the future, but you figure it's best to leave it to the experts. A few weeks later, you get a call from your parent who tells you that they've been released from the hospital and are on their way home.","As you make small talk with your parent, they suddenly go quiet for a moment before saying, \"Hey, did you hear about those creatures they found at the hospital?\" You feel a knot form in your stomach as you try to think of what to say.","Suddenly, your parent breaks out into laughter. \"Just kidding!\" they say. \"I saw it on TV and thought I'd mess with you.\" You let out a sigh of relief as the tension melts away.","In the end, the creatures turn out to be a new species of harmless fungus that had grown in the damp corners of the hospital. The scientists are fascinated by the discovery and name it after you in honor of your bravery during the incident. You smile to yourself as you imagine your name being written in textbooks for years to come."],"imageIds":["647cfb3d-8499-460e-a306-4e3de3e5e453","8fb26a3c-4b6d-4eb6-9aab-a180ccd6e764","0b63f8c6-714f-440a-9715-a3ab1d0d0234","1193bf2b-cb84-460c-8a85-952f62fbc35f"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":153}
