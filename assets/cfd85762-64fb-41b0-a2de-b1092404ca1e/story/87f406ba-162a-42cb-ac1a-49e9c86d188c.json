{"id":444,"name":"The Fall of the Cult","paragraphs":["You report the cult to the authorities, and they launch a massive investigation that leads to the arrest of dozens of members. Your family is among them, and you're forced to testify against them in court. The trial is long and grueling, but eventually, justice is served, and the cult is disbanded.","As you leave the courtroom, you can't help but feel conflicted. On one hand, you know that what you did was right, and that the cult needed to be stopped. But on the other hand, you can't shake off the feeling that your actions might have also led to the downfall of your family. You wonder if there was another way - a way to stop the cult without sacrificing everything else. You realize that sometimes, doing the right thing isn't always clear-cut, and that there are often difficult and complex ethical dilemmas at play."],"imageIds":["47050e26-9bce-441f-950f-d3abc66f8bf9","f1dd5eb1-a724-4eb6-862c-d45ce9767be5"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":239}
