You follow suit, and before long, you're both in the middle of a dance-off.","As the music reaches a crescendo, the figure becomes more erratic in its movements, almost as if it's losing control. You begin to worry that it might attack you, but then it suddenly stops and bows.","\"You've proven yourself worthy,\" says the figure, its voice sounding less menacing now. \"You may leave now and never look back.\"","You quickly make your way out of the hospital and into your car, feeling grateful to have made it out alive.
