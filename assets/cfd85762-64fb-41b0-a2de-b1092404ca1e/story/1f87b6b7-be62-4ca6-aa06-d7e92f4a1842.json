{"id":367,"name":"The Investigation","paragraphs":["You hire a ghost hunter to investigate the hospital, hoping that they can uncover the truth behind the strange symbols and unexplained phenomena. They spend several days combing through the hospital, using all kinds of high-tech equipment to detect any paranormal activity. You wait anxiously for their report, eager to find out what they discovered.","Finally, the ghost hunter presents their findings. They tell you that the hospital was built on top of an ancient burial ground and that the spirits of the dead are restless and angry. They recommend that you perform a cleansing ritual to appease the spirits and restore balance to the area.","You agree to the ritual, and the ghost hunter brings in a team of experts to perform it. They burn sage and chant incantations, creating a peaceful and calming atmosphere. As the ritual ends, you feel a sense of relief and hope that the spirits have finally been put to rest.","In the end, you decide to leave the hospital and start fresh somewhere else. You take your parent home with you and focus on rebuilding your lives together. You'll always remember the strange and terrifying events that took place in that hospital, but you also know that you'll never forget the love and strength that brought you through it all."],"imageIds":["f8c23bab-e7d6-421c-bcd7-bab66ec7ad25","a2d16800-bf9b-4ad0-924d-536e3a5bcd44","3d0b5315-f754-464b-9e01-2cd9163fce3c","aedc8b1f-20ee-4bea-ac3e-4f780c46e1b2"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":172}
