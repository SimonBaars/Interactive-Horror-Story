{"id":393,"name":"The Final Escape","paragraphs":["You run as fast as you can through the labyrinthine hospital, feeling like you're about to collapse at any moment. But just when you think you've hit a dead end, you spot a glimmer of light in the distance. You push yourself harder and move towards it, hoping that it's your way out.","As you get closer, you realize that it's an exit - a way out of this nightmare. You burst through the door and stumble out into the fresh air, gasping for breath. You're free - free from the hospital, free from the creatures, and free from the darkness that seemed to be consuming everything around you.","As you turn to walk away, you notice a small note lying on the ground. You pick it up and read it - it's a message from your parent. They thank you for everything you did to try and save them, and they tell you that they love you. Tears well up in your eyes as you realize that even though they're gone, their love will always stay with you."],"imageIds":["c6d7b69c-19a7-4d49-bfe6-73bad0931085","7a04b001-d57a-4e79-a3d6-a4878a45c764","10b3c4c7-4fde-4752-896e-98f806ca4081"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":196}
