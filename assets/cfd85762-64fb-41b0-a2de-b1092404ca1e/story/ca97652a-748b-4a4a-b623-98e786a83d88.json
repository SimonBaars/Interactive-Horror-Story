{"id":468,"name":"The Crumbling Wall","paragraphs":["You start to pound on the wall with your fists, hoping to make a hole big enough to crawl through. At first, it seems like nothing is happening, but then you hear a crack. You hit the wall again, and this time there's a bigger crack. You keep pounding away until you've made a hole big enough to see through.","What you see on the other side of the wall makes your heart sink. It's not an exit or help waiting for you, but rather a room filled with more of those creatures. They're all asleep, but you can see their chests moving up and down as they breathe. There must be at least a dozen of them in there.","As you watch, one of the creatures stirs in its sleep and opens its eyes. It looks directly at you through the hole in the wall and lets out a bloodcurdling scream. Within seconds, all of the creatures in the room are awake and scrambling towards you. You try to run away, but it's too late. They're upon you.","Just when you think it's all over, a blinding light fills the hallway. The creatures shriek and cover their eyes, giving you enough time to escape. You turn around to see what's behind you and see a group of people in hazmat suits. \"We've got this under control now,\" one of them says to you. \"You're safe.\" And with that, you collapse onto the ground, finally able to breathe a sigh of relief."],"imageIds":["f009555d-c2c5-4f34-9460-58a37bd6711b","75bf1651-5514-4051-8c31-f5bc38860d2e","2adefd76-6a6a-4ee2-8d26-11af6512a0fe","cae05d2a-c92c-45ec-8545-701f5ab7eac3"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":259}
