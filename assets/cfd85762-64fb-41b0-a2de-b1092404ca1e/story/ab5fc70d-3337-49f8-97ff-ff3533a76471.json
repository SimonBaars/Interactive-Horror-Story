{"id":470,"name":"Confrontation Comedy","paragraphs":["You gather all your courage and confront the armed men who have been pursuing you. However, as soon as you start talking, things take a hilarious turn. One of them recognizes you from a TV show you used to be on, and they all become star-struck fans. They ask you to sign autographs and take selfies with them instead of answering your questions.","As you're taking selfies, you notice that one of the men is wearing a nametag with the name of the very company that was responsible for creating the virus that infected you. You blurt out this information, hoping to get a reaction, but the men just look confused. It turns out that the company is actually a catering service that provides food for the studio where your old TV show was filmed.","You can't help but laugh at the absurdity of the situation. The men apologize for scaring you, and you end up having a friendly chat with them about your old TV show and their favorite episodes. You even exchange phone numbers and promise to stay in touch.","As you leave, you realize that sometimes, things aren't what they seem, and that laughter is often the best medicine. You decide to write a book about your experience and donate the proceeds to a charity that supports medical research."],"imageIds":["97f3b5ee-10ef-4d6a-b43d-86e9a2d6cfb4","adca73b3-0300-45e5-adf2-effd7e51a786","88e4e80f-f19d-41ea-aafc-a0222452aef5","1fec3efc-e4ba-4162-950a-9d90407f85fd"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":261}
