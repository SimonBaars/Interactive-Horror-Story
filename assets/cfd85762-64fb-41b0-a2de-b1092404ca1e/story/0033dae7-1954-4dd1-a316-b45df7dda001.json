{"id":435,"name":"The Price of Revenge","paragraphs":["You track down the conspirators responsible for your parent's death one by one, taking them out with cold efficiency. With each kill, you feel a sense of satisfaction and closure. But as the bodies pile up, you start to wonder if it's all worth it. Is revenge really what you wanted? Or is there something else missing?","One night, you have a dream about your parent. They're smiling at you, but there's a sadness in their eyes. They tell you that they love you, but they don't want you to continue on this path of vengeance. They implore you to find a way to make peace with what happened and move on.","When you wake up, you realize that your parent was right. Revenge isn't the answer. It won't bring them back, and it won't make things right. You decide to turn yourself in to the authorities and face the consequences of your actions. It's time to try and find a way to heal, and to honor your parent's memory by living a better life."],"imageIds":["5ca49bd4-04d5-4fe0-9c9c-6961212e55a2","df2ba29f-ae23-4d70-8054-8e6033f46c20","5755b0e2-d09c-4e6b-9127-cd4a3816df20"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":231}
