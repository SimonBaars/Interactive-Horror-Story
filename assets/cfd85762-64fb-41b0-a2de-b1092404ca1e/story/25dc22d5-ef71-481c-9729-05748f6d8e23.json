{"id":5,"name":"The Chair Fight","paragraphs":["You grab a nearby chair and swing it at the figure. It collides with the creature, sending it tumbling to the ground. For a moment, everything is silent. You think you've won, but then it stands back up, its eyes still glowing in the dim room.","The creature lunges at you again, but this time, you're ready for it. You dodge its attack and use the chair to strike it once more. This time, it doesn't get back up. You breathe a sigh of relief and move towards your parent's bed. That's when you notice that the symbols on their forehead have changed. They're slowly shifting into something else, something even more sinister.","Suddenly, the door bursts open, and a group of doctors rush into the room. They look surprised to see you there, holding a chair and standing over a strange creature's body. One of them approaches you cautiously and asks what happened. You try to explain, but they don't seem to believe you. Instead, they call security to take you away, leaving your parent behind."],"imageIds":["592b058d-dad4-4b43-8af7-c4d62ff5dbda","5b6744dc-2a87-4ecf-8285-82e3067ac47b","b67cd278-4a52-4c6e-8abd-d68436acd36a"],"optionNames":["Try to convince the doctors of what happened","Break out of the hospital","Make a run for it while screaming"],"optionDescriptions":["You try to convince the doctors that what you saw was real.","You decide that being held captive by the doctors is not an option, and you try to break out of the hospital.","You panic and make a run for it while screaming."],"optionIds":["fa187fd2-4252-4dcd-a223-94ff2f02ad59","c8242cba-8354-4539-afa6-744c468f2339","d0deef73-e996-47b5-b0db-41503a474262"],"optionImageIds":["7561c134-3666-4298-bed8-e9779922860d","55404df1-e79b-4c0f-9393-e125ce40223a","f6aa3a2a-b775-41cf-9c9e-9122adeeb048"],"ending":-1}
