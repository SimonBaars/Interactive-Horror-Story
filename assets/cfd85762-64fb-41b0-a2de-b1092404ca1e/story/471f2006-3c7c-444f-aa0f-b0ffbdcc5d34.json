{"id":257,"name":"The Secret Keeper","paragraphs":["You leave the hospital, haunted by the knowledge of what you've seen. You know that there is no way to explain to others what happened without sounding insane, so you decide to keep your terrible secret to yourself.","Weeks go by, and you try to return to your normal life. However, you can't shake the feeling that something is watching you from the shadows. Every time you hear a strange noise or see a flicker of movement out of the corner of your eye, your heart races with fear.","One day, you receive a package in the mail. Inside, you find a note from the creatures you met in the hospital. They thank you for your kindness and promise to never harm another human again. You feel a sense of relief but also a twinge of guilt for keeping their existence a secret.","From that day forward, you dedicate your life to protecting the secrets of the supernatural world. You become a sort of guardian for those who are different, ensuring that they are not hunted or persecuted by humans who don't understand them. It's a lonely and dangerous existence, but you know that it's the right thing to do."],"imageIds":["01d54bb3-00d3-4c18-992a-f4f769c557af","ba9971b1-c7da-47f9-b9df-22700212358f","374fbb88-8ac1-45e3-9834-b4cd3b9b4033","fa419845-8db4-4c7d-a49d-36dae2e93afe"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":76}
