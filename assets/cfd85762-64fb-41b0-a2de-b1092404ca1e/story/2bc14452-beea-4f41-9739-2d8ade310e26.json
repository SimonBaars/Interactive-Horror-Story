{"id":269,"name":"The Lone Survivor","paragraphs":["You start to make your way out of the hospital, hoping that you can find a way to safety on your own. It feels like every step is a struggle, and you're constantly looking over your shoulder, afraid that the creatures will find you. You finally reach the exit and burst out into the sunlight, feeling relieved that you've made it out alive.","As you start to walk away, you hear screams coming from inside the hospital. You know that the other survivors are still in danger, but you feel frozen in place. You realize that you could help them, but you hesitate, not wanting to risk your own life. Eventually, the screams fade away, and you're left alone with your own guilt.","You continue to walk away, feeling lost and alone. You don't know what the future holds, but you know that you'll always carry the weight of your decision with you. You vow to do better if given another chance, but for now, all you can do is keep moving forward."],"imageIds":["e797adbc-712f-4fdd-a434-8507355c44e2","98cce78e-8a71-4b36-8210-22ea27a68efd","664e7887-3c7a-4092-bb95-04fcebd54a5a"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":87}
