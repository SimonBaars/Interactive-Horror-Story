{"id":390,"name":"A Surprising Twist","paragraphs":["You take a moment to catch your breath and rest. As you sit there, the events of the past few hours begin to sink in. You've been through so much, and you're not sure what comes next. But then, something unexpected happens. A nurse walks up to you and hands you a letter. \"This was left for you,\" she says before walking away. Confused, you open the letter and read its contents.","The letter is from your parent, and in it, they reveal a shocking secret. You learn that they were part of a top-secret government program aimed at creating super-soldiers. They were injected with an experimental serum that gave them incredible strength and speed, but it came with a price. The serum also made them susceptible to a dangerous venom that could kill them if they weren't careful. You realize that this means the creatures that attacked your parent were likely others who had been injected with the serum.","As you contemplate the implications of this revelation, you feel a tap on your shoulder. You turn around and see a group of people in military uniforms standing behind you. \"Come with us,\" one of them says, motioning to a nearby helicopter. \"We need to debrief you on some things.\" You have no idea what lies ahead, but as you board the helicopter, you know that your life will never be the same again."],"imageIds":["e07ace1a-7ee1-4009-8d04-02744188e73e","e7b65450-4266-419f-bc6a-d07cdae02a33","324143a3-0874-4a71-8db8-b7d92c06fe24"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":193}
