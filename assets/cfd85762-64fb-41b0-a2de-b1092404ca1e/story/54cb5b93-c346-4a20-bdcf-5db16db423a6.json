{"id":422,"name":"The Investigation","paragraphs":["You spend the next few days digging into the Seekers' history and trying to find any information that might help you make a decision. You talk to people who have left the group, read old forum posts, and even watch a few documentaries about cults. The more you learn, the more confused you become. Some people claim that the Seekers are a force for good, while others say that they're dangerous and manipulative.","Finally, you decide to try and reach out to someone from the Seekers directly. You send a message to the person who first contacted you, asking for more information and expressing your concerns. They respond quickly, saying that they understand your hesitation but that they can't reveal too much over the internet. Instead, they offer to meet you in person at a neutral location.","You agree to the meeting, feeling both nervous and excited. You arrive at the designated spot - a small coffee shop in a quiet part of town - and look around nervously. After a few minutes, someone taps you on the shoulder. You turn around and see a figure wearing a black hooded cloak, their face obscured by shadows.","The figure introduces themselves as a member of the Seekers and begins to answer your questions. They tell you about their mission, their beliefs, and their goal of uncovering the truth about the supernatural. As they speak, you feel a sense of belonging growing inside you, a feeling that you've finally found the answers you've been searching for. But then, a voice in the back of your mind asks: \"What if it's all just a trap?\""],"imageIds":["949e25f8-21c6-4df3-9a84-234d89ba3eae","598a6c60-8b93-4c04-90df-a3a7f91543cf","2382e384-a54d-49fd-acdd-07b423398419","1d78a488-a396-4ae0-b3aa-6886eaf1617e"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":219}
