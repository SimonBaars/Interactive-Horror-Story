{"id":205,"name":"The Seance","paragraphs":["You gather a group of your closest friends and sit in a circle, holding hands around a table covered in candles and crystals. You close your eyes and focus on the image of the creature that's been haunting you. After a few minutes, something strange happens. You feel a cold breeze and hear a whisper that seems to be coming from inside your head.","When you open your eyes, the room is empty except for you. The candles have burnt down to nubs, and the crystals are scattered across the floor. You're confused and disoriented, not sure what just happened. As you stand up, you notice a piece of paper lying on the table. It's a drawing of the creature, but this time it's different. Its eyes are no longer glowing, and its skin is pale and waxy, just like when you saw it outside the convenience store."],"imageIds":["63d0e9c3-459d-4292-afaf-ca20fa1d75f7","4f9fd261-3e22-4580-8a9c-3502ead936fa"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":29}
