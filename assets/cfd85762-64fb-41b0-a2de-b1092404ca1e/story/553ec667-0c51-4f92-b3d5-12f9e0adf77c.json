{"id":480,"name":"A Fool's Errand","paragraphs":["You try everything you can think of to revive your parent - CPR, shaking them, even slapping them a few times (you know it probably won't work, but it's worth a shot). But nothing seems to be working. You start to feel like you're in a bad sitcom, trying to revive a dead person with no success. Eventually, you have to accept that there's nothing more you can do.","As you sit there, feeling defeated, you hear a voice behind you. You turn around and see a group of police officers holding off the creatures. They tell you to get down and stay quiet as they clear out the rest of the hospital. It's a small comfort, but at least you're not alone.","Once the hospital is secure, the police help you carry your parent's body outside. They tell you that they've been dealing with these creatures for a while now, and they're still trying to figure out what they are and where they came from. You thank them for their help, but you know that you'll never forget the horrors you experienced inside those walls.","As you walk away from the hospital, you can't help but reflect on everything that's happened. You made some tough decisions and faced some terrifying situations, but you also learned a lot about yourself. And sure, you may never want to enter another hospital again, but at least you have a good story to tell at parties (if you ever go to one again)."],"imageIds":["63cd5a7e-b009-4c18-931a-66e4ad2cbb2f","fb7919aa-ddfd-4145-85e6-110f6176c495","da8b9ce0-502c-4603-90d4-31bc6abe5cd5","f205a8fe-92e6-4a1f-9982-9e27403e0561"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":269}
