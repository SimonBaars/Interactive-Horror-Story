You're drenched in sweat, but you're relieved to be back in the real world. Your guide turns to you and says, \"Well, that was fun. We should do it again sometime.\" You look at them incredulously and reply, \"Are you crazy? I'm never sleeping again!\"","Your guide laughs and says, \"Don't worry, I'm just kidding. But seriously, you might want to lay off the spicy food before bedtime.\" You roll your eyes and say, \"Thanks for the tip, Captain Obvious.\"","Your guide chuckles and disappears into thin air, leaving you alone in your room. You look around, still feeling a bit disoriented from the dream. You shake your head and mutter to yourself, \"I need a vacation.\"","Just then, your phone buzzes, and you see a message from your friend inviting you on a trip to Hawaii. You smile and think to yourself, \"Maybe this is exactly what I need.\" You grab your phone and start typing a response, already looking forward to your next adventure."],"imageIds":["db78e80c-aa4b-479b-a168-55fa062eb2d1","153cf6eb-307b-4661-8de8-9c65663e2310","768b9270-5676-4673-aa49-683fe700a493","bd915745-6497-45ab-b1ce-76cdd8cb8032"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":38}
