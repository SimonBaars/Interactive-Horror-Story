We can work together and help each other.\" The creatures seem to be listening to you, and you take it as a good sign. You propose a peace treaty, promising not to harm each other and even offering to share some of your supplies.","There's a tense moment as the creatures consider your proposal. Then, they suddenly start nodding their heads and chattering excitedly amongst themselves. To your surprise, they seem to be happy with the idea. One of them steps forward and extends a hand, and you shake it, sealing the deal.","You work together with the creatures to barricade yourselves in a secure room and wait for rescue. It's not exactly the adventure you had planned, but you're grateful to be alive. Who knows? Maybe this experience will make for a great story someday."],"imageIds":["da12961c-e7ec-4a8b-9d86-19b83a5d85f6","e4a9341d-c499-4756-a6b4-ea121d6e877b","51c89a50-ebea-496a-886f-55c57a221ca4"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":297}
