They're surprised by your sudden arrival, but they don't seem afraid. One of them steps forward and says that they've been expecting you.","The group surrounds you, and you realize that this might have been a mistake. They're powerful and well-organized, and you're outnumbered. But you stand your ground, determined to save your parent from their clutches. The air crackles with dark energy as the group begins to chant, and you feel yourself starting to weaken.","Just when it seems like all hope is lost, there's a blinding flash of light, and a group of doctors burst into the room, accompanied by armed guards. They shout something about a raid and start rounding up the group members. You see your parent lying on a table in the corner of the room, surrounded by strange instruments. You rush over to them and find that they're still breathing, but only barely. You scoop them up in your arms and carry them out of the room, grateful to be leaving that place behind."],"imageIds":["c1a4a78f-5e49-443a-8676-b96924a6ad38","7d10cafe-231c-46d3-8462-8670a3c2001a","b96f52b3-77b0-4f94-b7c7-f4924423f8a1"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":4}
