{"id":387,"name":"The Unforeseen Creation","paragraphs":["You decide to create a work of art in memory of your parent. It takes time, but eventually, you produce something truly magnificent, a tribute to their memory that they would have been proud of. As you stand back and admire your work, you feel a sense of accomplishment and closure.","But as you examine your creation more closely, you notice something strange. The image seems to be moving, almost as if it's alive. At first, you think it's just your imagination, but the movement becomes more pronounced with each passing moment.","Suddenly, the image bursts forth from the canvas, taking on a physical form before your very eyes. You're shocked and terrified as the creature steps out of the painting, its eyes fixed on you. It's clear that this isn't any ordinary artwork, but rather something much more sinister.","As you scramble to get away, the creature reaches out and grabs you. You're powerless to resist as it drags you into the painting, trapping you in a world of endless darkness. Your fate is uncertain, and you can only hope that someone will find a way to rescue you from this nightmare."],"imageIds":["55c3ad62-05a5-47eb-a834-9e8ad49f9342","acdd74c6-2fdf-4b19-8c5e-7fab03e12459","55fbe8eb-918f-4a37-860b-299bc6fe79c2","161fe189-5815-41e5-abfa-5c117f1bbac4"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":190}
