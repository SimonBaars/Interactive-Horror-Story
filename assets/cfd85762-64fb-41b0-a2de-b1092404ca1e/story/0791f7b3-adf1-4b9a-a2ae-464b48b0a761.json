{"id":254,"name":"The Aftermath","paragraphs":["You receive medical attention for your wounds and recover in the hospital for a few days. As you lay in bed, you try to make sense of what happened. The creatures, the disappearances, the strange smell in the air... It all seems like a nightmare. But it was real. Suddenly, the door to your room bursts open, and a group of men in suits come in, accompanied by a woman with a badge.","They introduce themselves as government agents and inform you that the creatures you encountered are part of a top-secret biological experiment gone wrong. The creatures were designed to be super-soldiers, but they mutated and became uncontrollable. The government had been trying to cover up the incident, but your experience has made that impossible.","The agents offer you a deal: they will erase all record of your involvement in the incident and compensate you generously if you sign an NDA and agree never to speak of what happened again. You're torn between wanting to forget this nightmare and wanting to expose the truth to the world. But in the end, you decide to take the deal.","As you leave the hospital, you can't shake off the feeling that you've done something wrong. The memory of the creatures and the victims they claimed lingers in your mind, and you wonder how many more secrets the government is keeping from the public. But for now, you try to put it all behind you and move on with your life."],"imageIds":["6ef74b0c-44d9-404b-8c6d-63c2ea54cd34","7dbb6b19-175e-43dd-96e2-8a3c171b078d","1beebd81-c24d-4c17-a025-490ff820f8f4","079b7493-0333-4afd-91aa-4d6a608448d2"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":73}
