As you're inspecting a shelf of candy bars, you notice something strange about the packaging. The labels seem to be written in a language you don't recognize, and some of the bars have strange symbols etched into them.","Suddenly, you hear a noise coming from the back room. You cautiously move towards the door and push it open. Inside, you see a strange ritual taking place. The creature from the hospital is there, along with several other figures that you don't recognize. They seem to be chanting in unison, their voices getting louder and more frenzied by the second.","Before you can react, the creatures turn towards you, their eyes glowing menacingly.
