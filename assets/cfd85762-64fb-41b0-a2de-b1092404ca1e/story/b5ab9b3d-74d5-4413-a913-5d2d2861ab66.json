{"id":347,"name":"The Nap","paragraphs":["You lay down on the cold hard floor of the hospital hallway and close your eyes, exhausted from all the chaos and confusion. As you drift off to sleep, you hear the creatures shuffling around you, but you're too tired to care. You dream of warm blankets and soft pillows, completely oblivious to the danger that surrounds you.","When you wake up, it's hours later, and the hospital is eerily quiet. There's no sign of your parent or the creatures, and you're not sure what happened to them. You're also not sure how to get out of the hospital now that you've had a long nap. You realize that it was probably not the best idea to take a nap in the middle of a monster-infested hospital."],"imageIds":["b431127a-ca1f-42d8-9b6b-091d941b971c","32e7bc62-539b-49c6-9617-18ef4f9784a8"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":155}
