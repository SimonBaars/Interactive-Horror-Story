As they lurch towards you, you swing the scalpel wildly, trying to keep them at bay. You manage to kill a few of them, but the others quickly overpower you.","You wake up in a hospital bed, surrounded by doctors and nurses. Your body is battered and bruised, and you can barely move. You ask what happened, and one of the doctors tells you that you were found by a group of survivors who managed to fight off the creatures and bring you to safety.","As you recover, you hear stories of how the survivors banded together to fend off the creatures and protect each other. You feel a sense of guilt for putting your own survival above the lives of others, but you're also grateful to be alive.","You vow to make amends for your past mistakes and help the survivors rebuild their community. It will be a long and difficult road, but you know that you owe it to those who risked their lives to save yours."],"imageIds":["3295b2c2-88ba-47f2-8785-112fa3e33de2","4964b301-834b-4305-a917-ca6883fa6c5b","55baed53-bd40-4009-93ab-b07589d08934","81307ae2-8fea-4b20-92fe-e0219b622362"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":244}
