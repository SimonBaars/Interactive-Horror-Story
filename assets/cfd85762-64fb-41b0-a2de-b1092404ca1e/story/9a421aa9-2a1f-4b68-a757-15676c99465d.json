There's a tense silence in the hallway as everyone waits to see what will happen next. Then, one of the guards steps forward and asks you who you are and why you're here.","You tell them everything that's happened, about your parents' strange behavior, about the symbols on the wall, and about the voice that spoke to you in the cell.

They need all the help they can get."],"imageIds":["5332931d-78ec-48d2-a0f6-b9af7ce34597","34e7997a-5e09-4fa4-9c3c-bda8fe7322f4"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":217}
