{"id":486,"name":"The Forgiveness","paragraphs":["As you leave the hospital with the nurse, you can't help but feel a sense of relief. You've survived the ordeal, and even though things didn't go as planned, you're grateful for the nurse's help. \"Well,\" you say to the nurse, trying to lighten the mood, \"I guess we make a pretty good team.\"","The nurse chuckles. \"I don't think I'll be able to show my face around here for a while,\" they say, looking sheepish. \"But I'm glad that you're okay.\" You share a smile, and for a moment, everything seems normal again.","As you part ways with the nurse, you realize that you're not sure what will happen next. You don't know if you'll ever see the nurse again or if you'll be able to move on from this experience. But for now, you're just happy to be alive. You take a deep breath and look up at the sky, feeling the warmth of the sun on your face.","And then, out of nowhere, a group of birds swoops down and starts attacking you. You scream and flail your arms, trying to fend them off. The nurse runs back towards you, waving their jacket and shouting at the birds. It's chaos, but in a strange way, it's also hilarious. You and the nurse collapse on the ground, laughing uncontrollably, as the birds fly off into the distance."],"imageIds":["17a35447-94fb-4d18-aec4-b03329b859be","bb4269ce-c4ad-4714-bca9-561781989c64","85b73cbd-e7e2-46b0-86d1-7ec8e169392b","5fe6fe0c-d724-4a76-bd54-a18e6d40047f"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":275}
