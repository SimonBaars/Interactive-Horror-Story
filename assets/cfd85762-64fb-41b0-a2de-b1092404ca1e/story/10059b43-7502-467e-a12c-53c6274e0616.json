{"id":415,"name":"The Ultimate Sacrifice","paragraphs":["You take your parent's place on the altar, steeling yourself for what's to come. The cultists begin their chanting again, and you feel the room grow colder as a dark presence fills the air. You close your eyes and try to focus on your love for your parent, hoping that it will give you strength in your final moments.","Suddenly, there's a blinding flash of light, and you hear a deafening roar. When you open your eyes, you see a figure standing in front of you, blocking the cultists from completing their ritual. It's a being of pure light, beautiful and terrifying at the same time. You sense that it's here to help you, but you also know that its power comes with a price.","The being offers you a choice: you can let it destroy the cultists and save the world, but in doing so, you will be consumed by its power. Or, you can choose to spare the cultists, allowing them to escape to continue their plans, but you and your parent will be safe.","You make your decision, knowing that it will determine the fate of the world. As the being begins to glow brighter, you close your eyes and surrender yourself to its power. When you open your eyes again, you're no longer in the ritual chamber. Instead, you're outside, under a bright blue sky. Your parent is next to you, looking confused but unharmed. As you hold each other, you hear a voice in your head, thanking you for your sacrifice and telling you that you've saved the world."],"imageIds":["85b57443-1d16-49e9-9fcf-7158f8de49d0","036bc47b-1761-4c75-bc43-75d06ad19d54","60e16afe-2398-48a5-a613-5c168275a472","4a7e26ad-349b-46f2-bc86-cb7c94e75e60"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":214}
