At first, you feel a surge of power coursing through your veins, filling you with a sense of invincibility. You're ready to do whatever it takes to bring about the new world that the symbols promised.","But as the days pass, you begin to realize the true cost of embracing the darkness.

You are no longer in control of your own life.","And then, one day, the symbols stop speaking to you. You feel a sudden emptiness, a void where there was once a constant presence in your mind. You stumble out of your cell, disoriented and confused, only to find that the entire prison is empty. All around you, there are signs of struggle, of people fighting against something that they couldn't see. And then, you notice a single word etched into the wall in blood: \"Betrayer\"."],"imageIds":["bae030d0-a4da-423f-8e5c-8cb8a2f080dd","631eca86-5eac-4ca1-a800-8df5eb962a8b","784dc0ee-5728-4ff1-a6d1-c04a97497965"],"optionNames":["Hide in the prison","Lick the wall to taste the blood"],"optionDescriptions":["You try to find a place to hide in the prison and wait for rescue.","You decide to lick the wall to see if it really is blood."],"optionIds":["5246b189-ad03-48b8-8937-a15a7b288e17","522c2088-6692-42b9-96a3-d2718f73a718"],"optionImageIds":["2d3be412-1474-47ed-a9e5-038334220018","71740a97-1bc9-46cc-b221-368ed5bfe4fd"],"ending":-1}
