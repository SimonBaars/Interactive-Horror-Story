{"id":212,"name":"The Florist","paragraphs":["You start your own flower shop and quickly become known as the go-to florist in town. Your signature style is creating arrangements with bold colors and unusual combinations of flowers. One day, a customer comes into your shop looking for a special bouquet to give to their sick parent. They describe the symbols that they want included in the arrangement, and you realize with a shock that they're the same symbols that were on your parent's forehead all those years ago.","You ask the customer about the significance of the symbols, and they tell you a story that's eerily similar to what happened to you. As you listen, you realize that there are forces at work in the world that we don't fully understand. You make a mental note to always be open to the unexpected and to never underestimate the power of flowers."],"imageIds":["0e13f5e3-c2aa-4ac7-b530-212c99f07e29","b1517448-f6fe-439c-874a-1288946cf04d"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":36}
