{"id":360,"name":"Reasoning with the Creatures","paragraphs":["You raise your hands in a gesture of peace and try to talk to the creatures. To your surprise, they understand you and even start speaking back. They explain that they are not there to harm anyone but were trying to find their way back home. It turns out that they are aliens who had crash-landed on Earth and had been stranded in the hospital for weeks.","As you talk to the aliens, you learn about their planet and their journey to Earth. They tell you that they have been searching for a way back home but have had no luck so far. You realize that you might be able to help them and offer to assist in any way you can. The creatures seem grateful for your kindness and tell you that they will take you with them when they leave.","The police officer, who had been fighting off the creatures moments before, looks shocked as he sees you talking to them peacefully. He realizes that he had made a mistake and apologizes for his actions. Together, you and the officer help the aliens repair their spacecraft and get ready for takeoff. As you sit in the cockpit with the aliens, ready to depart, you can't help but feel a sense of excitement and wonder at what lies ahead."],"imageIds":["041c7b03-7b43-431c-b7d9-db7f48fbd085","881607a8-16d4-45c8-b811-609275deb813","be4997c0-2afd-4b5a-8d4c-0e39262678a1"],"optionNames":["Demand to be taken back to Earth","Ask to stay with the aliens","Steal the spacecraft and fly it yourself"],"optionDescriptions":["You demand to be taken back to Earth.","You ask if you can stay with the aliens and go on their intergalactic adventures.","You decide to steal the spacecraft and fly it yourself."],"optionIds":["df2e4980-d248-413e-ae93-bb0462d56624","b1201004-cac2-447c-bcc9-2c95bf200d5f","0061cb8e-889d-41dc-a92c-50fcced1cc6b"],"optionImageIds":["cea1938c-d1ff-4c92-927f-28055d4ece57","c7f51960-e83f-47fc-9a2f-0f17b50b379c","4eda6df5-ab92-4d75-88db-b40c02922970"],"ending":-1}
