{"id":342,"name":"The Creature Carriage","paragraphs":["To your surprise, the creatures nod their heads and make room for you and your parent on their backs. You hop on, feeling a bit like you're riding a very lumpy horse.

You thank them and offer them some of the leftover pizza in your fridge as a token of gratitude. They sniff at it suspiciously before gobbling it up and shuffling away into the night. You watch them go, feeling a bit sad to see them leave, but also relieved that you made it home in one piece."],"imageIds":["4b7293ca-2f65-4776-9a3a-70b6f0417f09","8e444f5f-cc04-45d7-b61f-05d6cb8d4ee7"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":151}
