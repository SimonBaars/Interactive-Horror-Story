After a few attempts, the lock clicks open, and you push the door open with a sense of triumph.","As you step out of the closet, you realize that something is different. The hallway is no longer dark and creepy, but brightly lit and bustling with activity. Doctors and nurses rush past you, hardly even noticing your presence. It's as if you've been transported to a different place entirely.","Confused and disoriented, you start wandering down the hall, trying to make sense of what's happening. You pass by a room with an open door and peek inside. It's your parent's room, but instead of being unconscious and covered in strange symbols, they're sitting up in bed, smiling at you.","\"You saved me,\" your parent says, tears in their eyes. \"I was so scared.\" You embrace them, relieved that everything is back to normal.
