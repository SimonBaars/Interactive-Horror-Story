For the first time in years, you feel truly at peace, enjoying long walks on the beach and sipping fruity drinks by the pool. But one night, as you're strolling along the shore, you see something that makes your blood run cold. It's a monster, unlike anything you've ever seen before.","You realize that this is no coincidence; the creature must have followed you here, seeking revenge for all the evil monsters you've slayed. You try to outrun it, but it's too fast and too strong. Just when you think it's all over, someone unexpected comes to your rescue. It's your former apprentice, who you thought had abandoned the hunter life long ago. Together, the two of you manage to defeat the monster and save the island from destruction."],"imageIds":["ba23f3b7-cf69-40be-a03a-839fad8b1aa3","beb533dd-fefe-44c4-b426-2d81e6eee34a"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":207}
