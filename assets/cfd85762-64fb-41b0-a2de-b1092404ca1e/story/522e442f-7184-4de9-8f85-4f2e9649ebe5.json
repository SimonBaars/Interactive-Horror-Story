{"id":260,"name":"Redemption","paragraphs":["You start your search for the child you left behind, using any resources available to track them down. After weeks of searching, you finally find a lead and follow it to a small town outside the city.","When you arrive in the town, you ask around and eventually find someone who knows about the child you're looking for. They direct you to a run-down orphanage on the outskirts of the town.","As you approach the orphanage, you start to feel nervous and anxious. You don't know how the child will react or if they'll even want to see you again. But despite your fears, you keep going until you reach the front door.","You knock on the door, and after what feels like an eternity, it opens. You see the child standing in front of you, looking surprised but also happy to see you. You apologize for leaving them behind and promise to make things right. You take the child into your care and vow to never leave them or anyone else behind ever again."],"imageIds":["93e61169-0c79-4a0b-8a60-f41c8d0ea52d","b463a2b4-f802-477d-b978-0a81af4feba4","2981608a-27db-4bac-9940-cd7ba31b2978","6b0c1a27-dcad-441d-8600-4253cbca10a6"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":79}
