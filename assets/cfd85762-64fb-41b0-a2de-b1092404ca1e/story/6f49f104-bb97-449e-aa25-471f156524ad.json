{"id":186,"name":"The Showstopper","paragraphs":["You start singing a show tune, hoping to distract yourself from the eerie surroundings. At first, it seems to work. You feel your spirits lifting as you belt out the lyrics. But then, something strange happens. The symbols on the wall begin to glow again, but this time with a different energy.","As you continue to sing, the symbols twist and writhe, forming new patterns and shapes. And then, they begin to move towards you, like tendrils of smoke. You try to step back, but they're too fast. They wrap around you, pulling you in closer.","You feel a surge of energy coursing through your body, and your voice changes. It becomes deeper, more powerful, almost like it's not even yours anymore. You realize that you've tapped into something ancient and primal, something beyond human understanding.","And then, just as suddenly as it began, it's over. The symbols recede back into the walls, leaving you standing in the center of the cell. You feel drained, exhausted, but also somehow exhilarated. You don't know what just happened, but you know that you'll never be the same again."],"imageIds":["4c45c9a2-ed89-45c8-a01e-8d4be916e4fb","42375ecd-e62f-4f7b-81e6-c51554efdd60","e08e6332-629f-4217-935e-00b496aee97a","26342510-4927-4004-bc36-20726d3b6135"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":12}
