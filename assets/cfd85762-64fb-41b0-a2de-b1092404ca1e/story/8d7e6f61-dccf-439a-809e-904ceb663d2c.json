{"id":375,"name":"The Great Escape","paragraphs":["You manage to find a ventilation shaft that's big enough for you and your parent to crawl through. It's dark and cramped, but you keep moving forward, hoping that it will lead you to safety. Along the way, you hear more screams and sounds of struggle coming from outside, but you're too focused on escaping to investigate further. Finally, you see a faint light at the end of the tunnel and realize that you've made it out.","As you emerge from the ventilation system, you see police officers and emergency personnel rushing around outside. They spot you and rush over to help you and your parent. You can't believe that you've managed to survive this nightmare, but you're grateful to be alive. As you watch the sun rise over the horizon, you know that you'll never forget this experience and that you will always be prepared for whatever challenges come your way in the future."],"imageIds":["cde4a121-7abb-44ef-b890-6bf31698716a","61f462fa-9743-4405-9ce7-850caf593d1c"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":180}
