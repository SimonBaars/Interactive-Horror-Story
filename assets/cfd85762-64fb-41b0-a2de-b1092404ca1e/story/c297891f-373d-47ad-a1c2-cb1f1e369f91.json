{"id":236,"name":"The Escape","paragraphs":["You run as fast as you can, heart pounding in your chest. Behind you, you hear the shuffling footsteps of the figure chasing you. You can see a door up ahead, and you push yourself to run even faster.","You burst through the door, panting and gasping for air. You look around frantically and see that you're outside. The sun is just starting to rise, casting an eerie light over everything. You don't stop running until you're several blocks away from the hospital.","As you catch your breath, you realize that you still have the scalpel clutched tightly in your hand. You shudder at the thought of what could have happened if you hadn't found it. You resolve to never return to that cursed hospital again.","Over the next few days, you recover from your ordeal. When you tell your parent what happened, they're understandably horrified. You both try to forget about the traumatic experience and move on with your lives, but you know that the memory of that dark hospital will stay with you forever."],"imageIds":["b92d5614-b5fa-4d38-a2cf-080ad81173da","d04e5432-617a-4821-940d-234194a33e7b","953107d2-1c47-4f06-96d5-09560eb8c4b1","d22e5f25-3c20-401b-a0c7-210fee1b964e"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":58}
