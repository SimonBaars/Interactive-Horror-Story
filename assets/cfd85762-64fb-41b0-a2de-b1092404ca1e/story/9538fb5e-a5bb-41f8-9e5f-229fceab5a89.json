{"id":263,"name":"Waiting for Rescue","paragraphs":["You and the child find a small room to hide in, barricading the door with whatever furniture you can find. You try to calm the child down, but your own heart is racing. You realize that you might be waiting here for a long time.","Hours seem to pass as you wait for help to arrive. Your stomach growls with hunger, and your mouth is dry from thirst. The silence is only broken by the sound of your breathing and the occasional creaking of the building. You start to feel hopeless, wondering if anyone will ever come to rescue you.","Finally, you hear the sound of footsteps outside the door. You're not sure if it's rescue or danger, but you're too weak to fight back either way. The door bursts open, and you see a group of armed soldiers. They rush in and quickly assess the situation, helping you and the child to safety.","As you exit the hospital, you see that the world outside has changed. It's no longer the peaceful, familiar place you remember. But at least you're alive, and that's all that matters right now."],"imageIds":["12e6c9ff-a4c4-4d04-b48b-6e8571cbb968","4e23fba3-a858-4aad-97e4-cbc16f413633","cb052606-9082-4b07-8bdd-7d3319d74214","26727225-ea62-4938-a4af-c8561d9ec92d"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":82}
