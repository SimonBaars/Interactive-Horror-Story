She tells you that this area of the hospital is off-limits and that you need to leave immediately before it's too late.","As you turn to leave, the figure from before suddenly reappears. The nurse shrieks in terror and runs away, leaving you alone with the figure. You brace for the worst, but instead, the figure hands you a key and nods towards the locked door.","With trembling hands, you unlock the door and step inside. What you see inside will haunt you for the rest of your life. There are strange symbols etched into the walls, and a sickly green light emanates from a strange object in the center of the room. Just as you're about to investigate further, the ground starts shaking, and everything goes black."],"imageIds":["7a7ba041-35f5-41f4-b61f-c64909dd8fc3","69b666d4-1c6c-472e-8fd9-7aa9fa205f56","227f0ae3-0967-413f-9fe5-68ac945f1dbd"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":54}
