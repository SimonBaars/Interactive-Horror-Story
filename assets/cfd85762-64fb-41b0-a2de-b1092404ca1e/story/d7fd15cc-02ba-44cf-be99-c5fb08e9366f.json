At first, they don't seem to be listening, but as you speak, you notice that their eyes start to soften, and their grip on the steering wheel loosens. Finally, they turn around and face you, revealing tear-streaked cheeks.","\"I'm sorry,\" they say, their voice choking with emotion. \"I lost my daughter in a car accident a few years ago, and ever since then, I've been trying to recreate that night over and over again.\" You feel a lump form in your throat as you realize the depth of the driver's pain and loss. After a long moment of silence, you nod and tell them that it's okay. They start up the car again, and this time, there's no hesitation or fear in their driving. You make it home safely, feeling grateful for the small moment of connection you shared with the driver."],"imageIds":["ae7f5b6d-bc91-4056-b32e-03460d26b7d0","dc4fc2b5-eb29-4e8e-8205-f7d7cd4ef234"],"optionNames":["Give the driver a hug","Report the driver to Uber"],"optionDescriptions":["You decide to give the driver a hug to comfort them.","You decide to report the driver to Uber for their erratic driving."],"optionIds":["016d9d92-b02a-4567-856e-5707f83c5071","259318a6-d02c-4808-a3c4-8d0bc425c7cb"],"optionImageIds":["aefef6f2-42ea-49a0-a74e-83a5dec627b2","16926d06-9386-48a4-85d1-ae76b03f5342"],"ending":-1}
