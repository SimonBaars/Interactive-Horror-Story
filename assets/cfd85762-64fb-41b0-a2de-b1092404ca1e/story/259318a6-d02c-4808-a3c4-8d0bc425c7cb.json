{"id":513,"name":"The Report","paragraphs":["You decide to report the driver to Uber for their erratic driving, hoping that they'll take action to prevent something like this from happening again. However, when you try to submit the report, you get an error message saying that there was a problem with your request.","You call Uber's customer service line and spend what feels like hours on hold before finally getting through to a representative. When you explain the situation to them, they tell you that they have no record of the driver who picked you up and that it's possible that they weren't an official Uber driver at all.","Your heart sinks as you realize that you may never get answers about what happened that night. You can't help but wonder if there was something more you could have done to prevent it all. As you sit alone in your house, you vow to be more vigilant in the future and to always trust your instincts."],"imageIds":["fc719322-eb8e-497d-9cea-38200c69f146","652a1df0-cb43-44d6-9cfd-fd8463ebe424","5fd0c99a-8c9c-4eaf-8645-b3ee77f40646"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":301}
