You turn around and see a group of shadowy figures in hospital gowns chasing after you. You try to outrun them, but they seem to be gaining on you with every passing second.","As you round a corner, you come face to face with a group of nurses and doctors wearing strange, cult-like robes. They surround you, their eyes glowing with an otherworldly light. You feel a sense of dread wash over you as you realize that you've stumbled upon something far more sinister than you could have ever imagined.","The figures begin to chant in an unknown language, and you feel a strange energy coursing through your body. You fall to the ground, helpless and paralyzed, as they prepare to carry out their dark ritual.","Just when it seems like all is lost, you hear a voice calling out to you. It's your parent, who's somehow managed to escape their hospital room and has come to save you. Together, you fight against the cultists and manage to escape the hospital. The experience leaves you shaken and traumatized, but you're grateful to have made it out alive."],"imageIds":["44e41cbe-b792-4567-a7ec-b482ccaca4e7","c3060fff-67f2-40ad-a301-056121ec07bc","b5a4814b-10f6-4375-b9b1-efbda2d6bfeb","a02ef5ce-7f04-4e20-93d9-0801e26dc2f4"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":110}
