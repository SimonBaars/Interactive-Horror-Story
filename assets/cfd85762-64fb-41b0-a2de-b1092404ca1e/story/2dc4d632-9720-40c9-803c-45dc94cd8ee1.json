{"id":374,"name":"Waiting Game","paragraphs":["You and your parent wait anxiously in the abandoned building, hoping that help will arrive soon. As time passes, you start to feel more and more uneasy. The strange symbols on the walls seem to be glowing faintly, and you can hear strange whispers coming from somewhere deep inside the building.","Suddenly, you hear a loud banging on the door. You freeze for a moment, unsure of what to do. Then you hear a voice on the other side of the door, calling out for you. It's one of the police officers who helped you escape from the hospital. They tell you that they've cleared out the area and that it's safe to come out.","You cautiously make your way towards the door, keeping an eye out for any signs of danger. When you finally open the door, you see a group of police officers waiting outside. They escort you and your parent to safety, and take you to a nearby hospital to receive medical treatment.","As you lay in the hospital bed, recovering from your injuries, you can't shake the feeling that something strange is still going on. You ask the police officers if they found anything unusual in the abandoned building, but they just shake their heads and tell you that it was probably just your imagination playing tricks on you. But you know that something strange happened in that building, and you can't help but wonder what secrets it holds."],"imageIds":["884299d1-ddc7-42ac-a679-1d4cfbdd5e31","c1f2a14a-a869-418a-ae25-066ce4fa4aae","6fe050c0-55f8-4a3c-9b68-3c2a8647603b","b6b9dbfe-06e9-402f-a7e8-7839254540df"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":179}
