As you harness their energy, you begin to see the world around you through a new lens. You realize that everything that came before was just a pale imitation of what's truly possible.","You use the symbols to bring about change, creating new worlds and new realities that defy explanation. You command the elements themselves, bending them to your will. And yet, there's always a nagging feeling in the back of your mind, a sense of unease that tells you that this power comes at a cost.","In the end, you realize that the cost was too high. You had to give up everything, even your own humanity, to gain this power. As you stand alone amidst the ruins of the old world, you wonder if it was all worth it.

And so, with a heavy heart, you begin your journey anew."],"imageIds":["663b1164-0a50-4abd-95f5-fa2784ac9500","1ed97916-d7a1-4c64-943c-f44bd274d41d","10d73069-062d-4d6c-86a5-184eaa355786"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":285}
