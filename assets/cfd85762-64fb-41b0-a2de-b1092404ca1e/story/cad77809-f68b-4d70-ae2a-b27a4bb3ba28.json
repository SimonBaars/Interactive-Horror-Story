The only sounds are the distant wails of sirens and the pounding of the rain. As you approach an alleyway, you catch a glimpse of movement out of the corner of your eye. You slowly inch closer, trying to stay quiet.","Suddenly, a hand reaches out and grabs you, pulling you into the darkness. You struggle to break free, but the grip is too strong. As your eyes adjust to the darkness, you see that it's another survivor. They tell you that they've seen others like you, running from the hospital. The two of you decide to team up and try to find safety together.","As you continue down the deserted streets, you hear the sound of footsteps behind you. You turn around to see a group of creatures closing in on you. You and your new companion run as fast as you can, but they're gaining on you. Just when all hope seems lost, a police car screeches to a halt in front of you, and the officers jump out, guns drawn.
