It's completely absorbed in the dance-off and doesn't appear to notice you.","Just as you're about to reach the door, you accidentally knock over a nearby tray, sending it crashing to the ground. The noise startles the figure, and it turns to face you, its eyes burning with anger.","You run towards the door, but the figure is too fast. It grabs hold of you, and you struggle to break free. Just when you think all is lost, there's a blinding flash of light, and the figure disappears.","You stumble out into the hallway, gasping for breath.
