{"id":404,"name":"Monsters Unleashed","paragraphs":["You start filming your documentary, traveling to different parts of the country to interview people who have survived monster attacks. Some of the stories are heartbreaking, while others are downright ridiculous. One person claims that a group of monsters stole their car and took it for a joyride.","As you continue filming, you start to notice a pattern. Many of the people who have been attacked by monsters have something in common: they all live near abandoned factories or nuclear power plants. You start to wonder if this is just a coincidence or if there's something more sinister going on.","In the final act of your documentary, you decide to investigate further. You sneak into one of the abandoned factories and find evidence of illegal experiments similar to the ones you uncovered during your revenge mission. Suddenly, you hear strange noises coming from deep within the factory. You turn to run, but it's too lateâ€”the monsters have found you.","After narrowly escaping the monsters, you realize that you've stumbled onto something much bigger than yourself. You submit your footage to the authorities, and a full investigation is launched. The perpetrators are brought to justice, and the monsters are destroyed once and for all. You receive an award for your documentary, and your parent would be proud of the impact you've made."],"imageIds":["712bbb12-41e4-41be-8138-1064f0e31f40","1ab32337-340c-483f-a527-9a945cae4136","125f9a45-0723-45aa-aa75-dc5085192b12","ce096002-1428-4c90-9cad-ea93e17bbe7d"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":205}
