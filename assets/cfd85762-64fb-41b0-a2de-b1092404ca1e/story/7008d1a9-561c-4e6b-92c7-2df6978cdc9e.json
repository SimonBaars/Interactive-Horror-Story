The child tells you that they are one of the many children who had been experimented on by a mad scientist in the hospital. They reveal that the scientist's experiments have gone horribly wrong and have turned the children into something otherworldly. The child begs you to help them escape.","Suddenly, the door to the room bursts open, revealing the monstrous forms of the once-human children. They lunge at you and the child with glowing eyes and razor-sharp claws. You grab the child and run as fast as you can down the hallway, pursued by the monsters.","As you reach the hospital's entrance, the monsters close in on you. Just when all hope seems lost, a group of armed agents bursts into the hospital and takes out the creatures.
