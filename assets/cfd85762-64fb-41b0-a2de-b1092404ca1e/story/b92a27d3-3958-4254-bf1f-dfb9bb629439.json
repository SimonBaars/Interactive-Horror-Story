{"id":207,"name":"The Mythical Truth","paragraphs":["The local expert's house is a sprawling mansion, surrounded by overgrown vines and an iron gate. You tentatively approach the door and knock. A voice from inside tells you to come in. You step inside and are greeted by a tall, imposing figure. They introduce themselves as a professor of mythology and ask how they can assist you.","You spill everything that's happened to you, starting with your parent's strange symbols and ending with the creature that chased you through the hospital parking lot. The professor listens intently, nodding occasionally. When you finish, they tell you that what you're describing sounds like a creature from ancient mythology, one that was once worshipped as a god. They explain that this creature is said to be able to control dreams and use them to manipulate its victims. The professor suggests that you try to find a way to enter your dream world and confront the creature on its own turf."],"imageIds":["701252f8-17ac-4512-862e-3ece7bcd17a5","4a84bc0c-b4cf-45ef-a26e-7708b0bb393e"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":31}
