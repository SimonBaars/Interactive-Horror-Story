{"id":452,"name":"The Art of Stealth","paragraphs":["You move stealthily through the hospital, trying to avoid detection by the creatures. As you make your way past them, you can't help but feel like a spy in a top-secret mission. Maybe you should consider a career change?","You duck behind a corner as one of the creatures passes by, and you realize that you've stumbled upon an unguarded supply closet. Score! You quietly slip inside and start gathering supplies for your escape. Who knew that gauze, cotton swabs, and hand sanitizer could be so useful?","After a few moments, you hear the sound of footsteps approaching. You freeze, holding your breath as the creature enters the room. It sniffs around for a moment before deciding that there's nothing to see here and moving on. Phew! That was close.","Finally, after what feels like hours of sneaking around, you find a door that leads outside. You push it open slowly, hoping that it won't creak too loudly. A gust of fresh air hits you in the face, and you step outside, feeling relieved and victorious. Your adventure might be over, but at least you've learned a new skill: the art of stealth."],"imageIds":["f41c8fec-2575-47bb-abae-671daf0e9645","dc5526ca-8141-458f-971f-7a2748c5c3a1","5791297b-1975-49d5-a7ab-869418e02b81","cdfac50a-a9db-4c46-b509-e74ed5b34d54"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":246}
