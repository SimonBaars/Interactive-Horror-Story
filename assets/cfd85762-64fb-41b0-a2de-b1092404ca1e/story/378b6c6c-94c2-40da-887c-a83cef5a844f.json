Your parent is lying on the ground, barely conscious, with several of the creatures crawling over them. You realize that there's no way you can fight them all off.","Without thinking, you grab a nearby fire extinguisher and charge towards the creatures. You manage to take out a few of them with well-placed blows, but more just keep coming. You feel yourself getting weaker and weaker as you fight.","In a last desperate attempt to save your parent, you use the last of your strength to lure the creatures away from them.
