{"id":179,"name":"The Last Stand","paragraphs":["You find a hiding spot in the prison and wait for rescue, but no one comes. Days turn into weeks, and you're running out of food and water. You begin to feel like you're the last person on Earth.","One day, you hear a noise outside your hiding spot. It's faint at first, but it grows louder and more insistent. You realize that someone, or something, is trying to get in. You clutch your makeshift weapon tightly and prepare for the worst.","When the door finally bursts open, you see a group of survivors, armed to the teeth and ready to fight. They tell you that there's been a war between the symbols and those who refused to join them, that the world has been torn apart by darkness and chaos. They offer you a chance to join their resistance, to fight against the evil that has consumed the planet. You take a deep breath and nod, knowing that this is your final stand."],"imageIds":["211fd23d-d6aa-48d0-bf7e-09b0dae052bb","753c7429-6426-4f26-ad70-84b5d1b5a85b","c51288ba-9d2c-41f9-bfc4-31c9dc148a0c"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":7}
