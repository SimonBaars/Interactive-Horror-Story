{"id":187,"name":"The Gas Station","paragraphs":["As you enter the gas station, you see a group of people huddled in the corner. They look startled and afraid when they see you, but they don't attack. One of them approaches you and asks what happened. You explain everything that's happened so far, and they listen intently. After you finish, one of them speaks up. \"We know what you're talking about,\" they say. \"We've seen it too. And we know how to stop it.\"","The group explains that they have been fighting against the darkness for years. They show you a book with ancient symbols and tell you that it contains the key to banishing the darkness for good. They teach you how to use the symbols and give you a mission: to find as many people as possible and teach them how to fight back. You leave the gas station feeling more hopeful than you have in a long time, knowing that you finally have a chance to defeat the darkness and save the world."],"imageIds":["ebf1d3d5-bfa5-4778-9d7c-2f81fe3163c4","b16adf9d-fb80-4bbd-b75f-8f4e0fd35521"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":13}
