{"id":439,"name":"The Trauma Warrior","paragraphs":["You start volunteering at a support group for people who have gone through traumatic experiences. You share your story and listen to others, providing comfort and understanding. One day, a new member joins the group and starts telling their story. It's almost identical to yours, except for one detail - they claim that the monsters had tentacles. You can't help but burst out laughing, realizing that all this time, you had been fighting off creatures with tentacles and didn't even notice.","As time goes by, you become a well-known figure in the community of trauma survivors. You start giving speeches and writing articles about your experiences, hoping to inspire others to seek help and get better. You even write a book about your journey, which becomes a bestseller. People start recognizing you on the street and thanking you for the impact you've had on their lives.","Looking back, you realize that the monsters and the hospital were just the beginning of your journey. They forced you to face your fears and traumas head-on, and in doing so, gave you a new purpose in life. You continue to help others and spread awareness about mental health, always remembering that even the scariest monsters can be defeated."],"imageIds":["59daa2db-29a9-49b8-83ac-f89a787a59b3","ffaa02a1-54b2-40dc-95c5-2e191e621de5","2916c8fb-0b5e-4acb-bff7-c23b59ed7435"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":234}
