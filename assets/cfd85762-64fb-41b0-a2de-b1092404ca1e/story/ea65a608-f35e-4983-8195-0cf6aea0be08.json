{"id":188,"name":"The Chase","paragraphs":["You keep running, your heart pounding in your chest. You don't know where you're going, but you can't stop now. Suddenly, you hear something behind you, and you glance back just in time to see a figure emerge from the shadows. It's the same creature that attacked you in the hospital. You scream and pick up the pace, hoping that you can outrun it.","You run through the deserted streets for what feels like hours until you finally collapse from exhaustion. When you wake up, you're lying on a hospital bed with a nurse standing over you. She explains that you were found wandering the streets and brought to the hospital. You try to explain everything that happened, but she just looks at you sympathetically and tells you that you must have had a bad dream. As you lie there, you realize that maybe she's right. Maybe it was all just a nightmare, after all."],"imageIds":["24cde08e-eee3-43ca-b316-b4592b58545c","b7bbeb05-d11c-4c6d-9b6f-661b252db33d"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":14}
