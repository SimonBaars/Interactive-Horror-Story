{"id":323,"name":"The Call for Help","paragraphs":["You search through the old hospital rooms, looking for a phone. After a few false starts, you finally find an old rotary phone in one of the nurse's stations. You dial 911 and wait anxiously as the call goes through.","When the operator answers, you explain your situation, and they tell you that help is on the way. As you hang up the phone, you hear a noise behind you. You turn around and see one of the creatures from the hospital staring back at you.","With no other options left, you grab the phone receiver and swing it at the creature with all your might. It connects with a loud thwack, and the creature crumples to the ground. You realize that this is your chance to escape before more of them show up. You run out of the room and into the bright sunlight, feeling relieved and grateful to be alive."],"imageIds":["bf9cbcae-37da-4a00-8db8-2cfef94c2eff","eed0b71b-336b-400a-83bc-8c1eb3cf3779","2a58f259-6ecc-496a-a906-bf0dd28ec297"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":138}
