{"id":455,"name":"Family Matters","paragraphs":["You dial your parent's number, and after a few rings, they answer. \"Hi, sweetie, is everything okay?\" they say. You take a deep breath and launch into the story of what happened at the hospital. There's a long pause on the other end of the line before your parent responds. \"Wait...you went to that hospital? The one that's been abandoned for years?\" You feel your face flush with embarrassment as you realize your mistake.","After some awkward silence, your parent starts laughing. \"I'm sorry, sweetie, I shouldn't be laughing, but...oh my goodness.\" You can't help but chuckle along with them, relieved that you're not actually in danger. \"Don't worry,\" your parent says. \"I'll come pick you up and we can get some ice cream.\"","A few minutes later, your parent pulls up in front of the police station in their car. As you hop in, they turn to you with a grin. \"So, what flavor do you want?\" You can't help but smile, grateful for the silly, loving parent you have. You tell them your favorite flavor, and soon you're cruising down the highway, windows down and music blasting.","As the wind rushes past you and the sun sets over the horizon, you realize that maybe getting lost in a spooky abandoned hospital wasn't such a bad thing after all. Sometimes, it takes a scary situation to remind us of what really matters: the people we love and the memories we make with them."],"imageIds":["25ce151f-1cc6-4414-84b9-0a163236c356","d8f637b6-b908-4fbc-92eb-0451e5f55172","1e772ebe-359b-41ab-a1e1-0515a5dca8c3","d388e19e-9ce7-4b8d-9244-4f3b53cd85ce"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":249}
