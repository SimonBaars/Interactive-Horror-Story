{"id":176,"name":"Mom to the Rescue","paragraphs":["You call your mom and explain everything that's happened. She listens patiently, then tells you to stay where you are. She says she'll be there as soon as she can.","While you wait for your mom to arrive, you try to piece together what's happening. You remember the symbols on your parent's forehead, the strange creature in their room, and the chanting figures in the ritual chamber. You're not sure what any of it means, but you know that it's dangerous.","Your mom arrives a few minutes later, and you run to hug her. She asks if you're okay and you tell her that you're scared. She puts an arm around you and leads you to her car. As you drive away from the hospital, you feel safe for the first time in days.","As you pass by a street corner, something catches your eye. It's a man wearing a hooded robe, standing perfectly still and watching you. His eyes glow in the darkness, and you realize with a start that he's one of the chanting figures from the ritual chamber. You pull out your phone to take a picture, but when you look back up, the man is gone."],"imageIds":["913c49e9-4180-4a18-8167-eeba42116dcf","461f587e-2031-491f-af37-c81e361cd2fd","ba21b81f-c7a6-4f27-a930-170dfef18350","5ef067e2-8cd3-4672-a1cb-53a21f2e111c"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":5}
