{"id":490,"name":"Chef vs. Monsters","paragraphs":["Using your cooking skills, you craft a myriad of makeshift weapons from kitchen utensils and ingredients. You fashion a spoon into a dagger, sharpen a frying pan into a shield, and concoct a spicy hot sauce that can blind the creatures. Armed with your culinary creations, you set out to battle the monsters and protect your restaurant.","The creatures attack MonstrEats, but you're ready for them. You dodge their attacks while using your unique weapons to fight back. You hurl ladles of boiling water at them, choke them with clouds of flour, and chop their tentacles with a meat cleaver. As you battle, you realize that your cooking skills have given you an edge against these monsters.","After a grueling fight, you emerge victorious over the monsters. You survey the destruction left behind and realize that it's time to move on. You close MonstrEats for good, but you take the lessons you've learned with you. You know that no matter what challenges come your way, you'll always be able to rely on your creativity and resourcefulness to overcome them."],"imageIds":["6501b834-462b-4570-b276-4427c8f75fb9","59b13310-0e0f-406b-8244-625ee590517c","17e8e5be-47b6-41ad-a721-68708f93389b"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":279}
