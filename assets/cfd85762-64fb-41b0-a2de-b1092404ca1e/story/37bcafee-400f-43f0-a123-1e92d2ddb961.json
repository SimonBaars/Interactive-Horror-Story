{"id":467,"name":"The Dance-Off","paragraphs":["You step out of the car and strike a confident pose, ready to take on the driver in a dance battle. To your surprise, they accept your challenge and step out of the car themselves. As the music starts to play, you both begin to dance with wild abandon.","However, as the dance-off reaches its climax, something strange begins to happen. The driver's body begins to contort and twist in unnatural ways, and their skin peels away to reveal a mass of writhing tentacles underneath. You realize too late that you've been tricked, and the creature that was once your Uber driver has revealed its true form.","You dive out of the way just in time as the creature lashes out at you with one of its tentacles. With adrenaline pumping through your veins, you sprint down the street, trying to put as much distance between you and the creature as possible. As you run, you realize that this nightmare isn't over yet, and that there are still more dangers waiting for you in the darkness."],"imageIds":["ba09ebef-4582-4815-89d6-104e96e6e77c","04e96d17-cf36-4d42-9168-f1f10b936c94","11b1e390-677d-40f7-a308-673324b69376"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":258}
