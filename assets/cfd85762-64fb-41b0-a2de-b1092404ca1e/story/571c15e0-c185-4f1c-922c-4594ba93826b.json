{"id":277,"name":"The Great Escape","paragraphs":["You sprint down the hallway, dodging security guards and scientists as you go. The facility is a maze, and you have no idea which way to go. You hear footsteps and shouting behind you, so you take a left turn and find yourself in a dimly lit corridor. You keep running until you reach a dead end, and you realize that you're trapped.","Suddenly, an idea strikes you. You remember seeing a ventilation shaft earlier, and you make a run for it. You find the shaft and crawl inside, hearing footsteps getting closer and closer. You crawl as fast as you can, ignoring the dirt and grime that covers your clothes. After what seems like hours, you finally see daylight at the end of the shaft. You burst out of the opening and find yourself outside the facility, free at last."],"imageIds":["89733f4c-e44f-495c-a3b1-979d2fc80712","00e696d0-d493-4a26-9fd5-96511892b98d"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":95}
