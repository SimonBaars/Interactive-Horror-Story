{"id":302,"name":"Building a Community","paragraphs":["You begin your search for other survivors, traveling through the wasteland and scavenging for supplies. After several days of wandering, you come across a group of people who have taken refuge in an abandoned factory. They're initially suspicious of you but eventually warm up to you after you prove your worth by helping to fortify the factory's defenses.","As time passes, more survivors join your community, and you work together to make the factory into a livable space. You start to feel a sense of purpose again as you contribute your skills to this new society. You share stories around the campfire at night and work together on projects during the day.","It's not easy living in the wasteland, and there are many challenges to overcome. You have to fend off raiders who try to steal your supplies, scavenge for food and water, and deal with sickness and injury. However, you find strength in each other and in the bonds you've formed.","You don't know what the future holds, but you're grateful for the present and the community you've built. You've found hope in a world that seemed hopeless, and you plan to keep fighting to ensure that your community survives. Together, you'll face whatever challenges come your way."],"imageIds":["8e900ede-704a-45b6-ad7e-db573de9ca72","ea43ea6d-ef58-4943-b055-2fb0627ea6e1","9790cc88-1f19-4136-8aee-c30a80af40da","43cd374b-7db9-4d19-a32c-d90fcddea9e8"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":117}
