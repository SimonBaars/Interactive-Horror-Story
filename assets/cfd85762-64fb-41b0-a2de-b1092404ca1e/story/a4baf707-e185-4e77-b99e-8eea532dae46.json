You quickly make your way inside and close the door behind you. The room is dark, and you can't see anything. You feel around for a light switch and finally find one. As you flick it on, you realize that this room is no ordinary storage room. It's filled with strange objects and symbols that you don't understand.","You hear footsteps outside the door, and your heart beats faster as you try to control your breathing. Suddenly, the footsteps stop, and you hear a voice whispering something in a language you don't recognize. You try to stay still and quiet, but you can't shake off the feeling that something terrible is about to happen. Then, just as suddenly, the footsteps retreat and the whispering stops. You wait for a few more minutes before cautiously opening the door and peeking outside. The hallway is empty, and there is no sign of anyone."],"imageIds":["6d99afc3-5ddc-4973-80e0-789fe94e4984","82b48f38-bed3-4af7-9db8-7075480b5d9f"],"optionNames":["Investigate the strange objects and symbols","Yell out loud and ask if anyone is there"],"optionDescriptions":["You decide to investigate the strange objects and symbols in the room.","You panic and yell out loud, asking if anyone is there."],"optionIds":["4f70b318-d055-478f-93c2-c9e76e34576c","a5afb5dd-5d1a-425f-ac14-257e4126f724"],"optionImageIds":["15ee90e3-bb2f-4479-97bb-d0a24064631f","f29b7ccd-220d-46a0-b9ea-23f5f9d5303a"],"ending":-1}
