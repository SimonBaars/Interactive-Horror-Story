{"id":215,"name":"The ID Card","paragraphs":["Your guide looks at you with an amused expression and hands you their ID card. When you look at it, you see that it has your picture on it instead of theirs. You remember the strange symbols on your parent's forehead and realize what's going on. You're not just dreaming—you've been possessed.","You try to fight back, but the possessing entity is too strong. It forces you to do things you don't want to do, like hurt people and cause chaos. The last thing you remember before losing control completely is the voice of your guide saying, \"I'm sorry, it had to be you.\"","You wake up in a hospital bed, surrounded by your loved ones. They tell you that you've been in a coma for weeks and that they're amazed you've finally woken up. You try to explain what happened, but they brush it off as the ravings of a sick mind. You're not sure if what you experienced was real or just a nightmare, but you know one thing for certain—it will haunt you for the rest of your life."],"imageIds":["c1a9d3c4-6a06-4f14-9fc7-1b56ed8d7e9d","dee9056a-3513-457c-9177-4b4acc9d5b4e","19184466-2867-432d-9023-cb72b1c375de"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":39}
