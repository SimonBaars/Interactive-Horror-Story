The walls become less dingy and covered in dust, and the floorboards feel more stable beneath your feet.

You turn around and see a group of people walking towards you. They're dressed in old-fashioned clothing and look confused by your presence. One of them steps forward and asks who you are and what you're doing here.","You tell them your story, and they listen intently.
