{"id":512,"name":"The Hug","paragraphs":["You step out of the car and walk around to the driver's side. They roll down the window, and you lean in for a hug. As you embrace, you feel their body shake with sobs, and you realize just how much they needed this moment of connection.","You both pull back from the hug, feeling a sense of peace and understanding. \"Thank you,\" the driver says softly, wiping tears from their eyes. \"I don't know what I would do without people like you in the world.\" You nod, feeling a lump form in your throat. As you walk towards your house, you look back at the car one last time, feeling grateful for the small moment of humanity that you shared with the driver."],"imageIds":["eac49551-ffaa-4bf1-8575-76feb6abb9b8","b46e0cf4-504a-4734-b15a-47a64f23becc"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":300}
