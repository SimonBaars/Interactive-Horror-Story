{"id":459,"name":"The Way Out","paragraphs":["You keep walking through the empty hospital, searching for a way out. Suddenly, you hear a faint noise coming from one of the rooms. You cautiously approach the door and peek inside, only to find an odd-looking machine humming quietly in the center of the room.","As you examine the machine, you notice a small button labeled \"EXIT.\" Without hesitation, you press the button, and the machine comes to life with a loud whirring sound. You feel yourself being lifted off the ground and pulled towards a bright light at the top of the machine. You close your eyes and brace for impact, but when you open them again, you find yourself standing outside the hospital, safe and sound.","Suddenly, a message pops up on your screen: \"Congratulations! You have successfully completed the game. Thank you for playing!\" You sit there in shock for a moment, realizing that everything you just experienced was part of a virtual reality game. You laugh to yourself, amazed at how realistic it felt. As you take off your headset and stand up, you can't help but wonder what other adventures await you in the world of virtual reality."],"imageIds":["6a0128ab-dcd9-481e-a097-ff68c84be00c","ca38bfe7-6ecb-4041-a4d0-e363010a2369","302e5cff-bf0d-42f1-8b94-ce18b8819667"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":252}
