{"id":265,"name":"The Zombie Outbreak","paragraphs":["You and the other survivors laugh off your earlier comments about zombies, but then you hear a strange noise coming from the hospital. Suddenly, a group of figures lurch towards you, their eyes glazed over and their movements jerky and unnatural. It's like something out of a horror movie, but this time it's real.","You realize that your jokes about zombies were a premonition of what was to come. You grab whatever weapons you can find and start fighting back against the horde. Some of the survivors get bitten and turn into zombies themselves, making your mission even more difficult.","As you fight for your life, you remember the skills and knowledge you learned from all those zombie movies and video games. You use every trick in the book to stay alive, but it feels like an uphill battle. Just when it seems like all hope is lost, you hear a faint sound in the distance.","The sound gets closer and louder, and soon a group of soldiers arrives to save the day. They explain that the zombie outbreak was caused by a rogue experiment gone wrong, and that they've been sent in to contain the situation. You finally breathe a sigh of relief and realize that you've survived a real-life zombie apocalypse."],"imageIds":["6d50a3c6-4b67-4cd0-aa84-5218e1d55638","aaf79791-1113-4322-b4e1-a4fcde208ab8","f87b84fc-1f46-4ff7-b5f9-ed58bca782ce","03b57010-71a0-4d1e-acaf-7edd5f8b1e7b"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":84}
