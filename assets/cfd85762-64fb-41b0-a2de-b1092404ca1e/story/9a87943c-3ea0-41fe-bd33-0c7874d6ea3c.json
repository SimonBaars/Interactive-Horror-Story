You don't stop until you're several blocks away from the masked people, and even then, you keep running. You don't know what those people wanted or why they targeted you, but you know that you never want to see them again.","Eventually, you slow down and start to catch your breath. You realize that you're lost and have no idea how to get back to where you started. You try to retrace your steps, but everything looks unfamiliar. You start to panic until you hear a voice behind you.","\"Hey, are you okay?\" the voice says. You turn around and see a friendly-looking stranger standing there. They offer to help you find your way home, and you gratefully accept. As you walk with them, you realize that things aren't as scary as they seemed before. You feel safe for the first time in what seems like forever.","Suddenly, everything around you fades away, and you find yourself staring at a computer screen. You realize that it was all just a game, and you had been playing it for hours. You sit back in your chair, feeling both relieved and disappointed. It was just a game, but it felt so real. You can't wait to play again."],"imageIds":["bc3cc119-af44-429c-b5d4-978332270226","01d2f5da-0d98-46e9-a1d4-c1139985a858","92132159-7997-47fa-87c0-ae74cab45459","89323007-6255-4b08-8edd-6da80b16c7c3"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":19}
