They seem skeptical but eventually agree to let you go, provided you follow up with a sleep specialist.","As you leave the hospital, you can't shake the feeling that something isn't right. You turn around and see a figure standing in the shadows, watching you. It's the same creature that attacked you earlier, but this time it looks different. Its eyes are no longer glowing, and its skin is pale and waxy. It opens its mouth to speak, but all that comes out is a low growl.","You run away as fast as you can, trying to put as much distance between yourself and the creature as possible. Eventually, you stumble across a small convenience store and run inside, hoping to find help. The store clerk looks up at you from behind the counter, surprised to see someone in such a state. You try to explain what happened, but your words come out jumbled and panicked. The store clerk nods sympathetically and hands you a cup of coffee, telling you that everything will be okay."],"imageIds":["91878d33-3566-49c0-88e0-0d78b6dc4c69","43501999-cd43-4b62-8cb3-7967b29386be","e6c10eb5-b786-42cc-be54-e1abd902928d"],"optionNames":["Call the police","Ask the store clerk for help"],"optionDescriptions":["You decide to call the police and report what happened.","You ask the store clerk for help and hope that they know what to do."],"optionIds":["ed8ad011-a9bd-41a3-98a7-01f3a7cf83a4","3eb81f5a-14c8-47b4-9a69-eefcbdb859b6"],"optionImageIds":["9444d886-457c-4c84-9dbe-15198c9ef25f","61a18c0b-eef6-43cd-9718-0f95ef444064"],"ending":-1}
