{"id":434,"name":"The Negotiation","paragraphs":["\"Please, let me go,\" you say, trying to keep your voice steady. \"I don't want to be here anymore.\" The figure looks at you for a long moment, then lets out a sigh. \"Fine,\" it says. \"I'll let you go... on one condition.\"","\"What condition?\" you ask warily. The figure pulls out a small slip of paper and hands it to you. \"You have to sign this waiver saying that we're not responsible for anything that happens to you while you're here,\" it says. You give it a quick glance and notice that it's written in a language you don't recognize. \"Um, can you translate it for me?\" you ask.","The figure gives you a wry smile. \"It basically says that you acknowledge the risks of being here and agree not to hold us liable for any injuries or damages,\" it explains. \"Standard stuff, really.\" You furrow your brow, unsure if you should sign it. \"Can I at least get a lawyer to look at it first?\" you ask hopefully.","The figure shrugs. \"Sure, if you can find one willing to work pro bono,\" it says. You groan, realizing that you're stuck. But as you reach for the pen, the figure stops you. \"I'm just kidding,\" it says with a laugh. \"We don't actually have waivers here. You can go.\" You breathe a sigh of relief and rush out of the closet, vowing never to come back."],"imageIds":["add46486-2c3d-4b5a-9142-61ccf9d8fd01","3f79f6f7-f3ba-42c0-8e15-49f7ab2ca8c9","2a63d240-942a-436d-b6a2-ac72b13bfee5","95c9a25d-8b43-4d48-9c05-2d61747b3ae2"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":230}
