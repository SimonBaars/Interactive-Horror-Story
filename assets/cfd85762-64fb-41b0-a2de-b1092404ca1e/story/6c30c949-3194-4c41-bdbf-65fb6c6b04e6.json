{"id":201,"name":"The Horror Within","paragraphs":["You continue exploring the building, your heart pounding in your chest. As you turn a corner, you see something that makes your blood run cold. There's a room at the end of the hallway, and it's filled with strange artifacts and symbols. In the center of the room, you see a figure dressed in black robes, chanting in a language you don't understand.","You're about to back away slowly when the figure suddenly stops chanting and turns to face you. Its eyes seem to bore into your soul, and you can feel its power radiating off of it in waves. You know that you need to get out of here, but you're not sure if you'll be able to make it past this creature.","Suddenly, the room starts to shake, and you hear a piercing scream that seems to come from everywhere and nowhere at once. You turn to run, but it's too late. The figure has captured you, and you know that there's no escape. You close your eyes, praying for mercy.","When you open your eyes again, you find yourself lying in a hospital bed, surrounded by doctors and nurses. They tell you that you were found wandering the streets in a daze and that you've been unconscious ever since. But you know the truth. You know that the horror you experienced was real and that it's still out there, waiting for its next victim."],"imageIds":["71382d96-3fe8-46c2-8549-813827eac043","10a0584f-9b9f-494f-bef4-ff8a40cef752","eda0a571-076c-4039-97a2-d9a87ba6e24c","bcb352aa-0c42-4db8-9419-41c4d1b9a92d"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":26}
