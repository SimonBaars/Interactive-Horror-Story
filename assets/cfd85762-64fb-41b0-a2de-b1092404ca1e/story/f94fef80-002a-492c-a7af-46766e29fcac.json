{"id":30,"name":"The Escape Attempt","paragraphs":["You search the cell for anything that might help you escape. After a few minutes, you notice a loose brick in the wall. You pry it out with your fingers and find a tunnel behind it. Without hesitation, you crawl through it, hoping it will lead you to safety.","The tunnel is tight and claustrophobic, but you push on, crawling as fast as you can. After what seems like an eternity, you emerge on the other side, panting and covered in dirt. You're in a dark hallway with doors lining both sides. One of them is slightly ajar, and you can hear voices coming from inside.","You peek inside the room and see a group of people gathered around a table, chanting in an unfamiliar language. In the center of the table is a book, open to a page filled with the same symbols that were etched into your parent's forehead. As you watch, one of the people looks up and sees you. They scream, and the others turn to face you, their eyes glowing in the darkness."],"imageIds":["3649140e-cf59-42d5-86e0-cd6d91a79a38","7470927a-28b5-43db-89f5-05b0942d8b13","66879971-9b54-4f24-adb5-8ed51c9403f8"],"optionNames":["Confront the group","Hide and listen","Run away screaming"],"optionDescriptions":["You confront the group and demand answers.","You choose to hide and listen to what the group is saying.","You panic and run away from the group while screaming at the top of your lungs."],"optionIds":["133caeff-69c8-471d-a85e-4729b8393ce0","ffe5304c-993f-4bac-ba4c-929bbb1242cd","7d5c9d5b-6dcc-43df-8a9e-98e782fee4be"],"optionImageIds":["00810f4a-7608-40ee-b54c-0deebe4bb965","393f4cb9-7d75-4cb3-ad98-28802ca02b05","a2e67009-6fee-4676-aaaf-caa0ea67ffcc"],"ending":-1}
