You're both grateful to be alive, but you can't shake the feeling that something like this could happen again.","When you get home, you help your parent inside and make sure they're comfortable. As you sit down to rest, you notice that there's something different about them. They seem more alert and focused than they have in years. They explain that they had a strange dream while they were unconscious, and it gave them a new perspective on life.","Over the next few weeks, you and your parent work together to rebuild your lives. You start to notice little changes in both of you. You're more patient and understanding, and your parent seems to have a newfound sense of purpose. You don't talk about what happened that night, but you both know that it brought you closer together.","In the end, you realize that the creatures were just a symptom of a deeper problem. You and your parent were both struggling with your own demons, and it took a night of terror to bring those issues to the surface.
