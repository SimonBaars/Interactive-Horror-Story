The mysterious symbols on the walls seem to be getting more elaborate and sinister as you progress deeper into the building.","Suddenly, you hear a loud noise coming from one of the locked rooms. You try to break down the door, but it's no use. You realize that you're trapped in the building with no way out.","As you start to lose hope, you hear a faint whispering coming from behind the wall.
