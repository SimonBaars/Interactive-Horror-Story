{"id":319,"name":"The Great Escape","paragraphs":["You make your way quietly through the hospital, doing your best to avoid any creatures or hospital staff. As you near the exit, you hear a loud roar coming from behind you. You turn around to see one of the creatures standing just a few feet away, its eyes fixed on you.","You freeze for a moment, unsure what to do next. But then, you remember the makeshift weapon you grabbed earlier. You pull it out and hold it up in front of you, hoping to scare the creature off. To your surprise, it seems to work - the creature screeches and runs off down the hallway.","With the way clear, you quickly make your escape out of the hospital and into the cool night air. As you walk away from the building, you can't help but feel relieved that the ordeal is finally over. But at the same time, you know that you'll never forget the strange and terrifying experience you had inside those hospital walls."],"imageIds":["76aef4a8-5687-4ea2-9529-2a7148ea68d9","93830cee-bf15-436f-8503-38c851458734","51c6be28-a02e-4e46-bfc6-2ea9ad61fe25"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":134}
