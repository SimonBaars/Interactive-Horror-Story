{"id":398,"name":"The Consequences of Delay","paragraphs":["You leave the hospital feeling uneasy, but you convince yourself that it's just your imagination. It's late, and you're tired, so you decide to come back tomorrow when you're more rested. You try not to think about the strange noises or the feeling of being watched as you drive away.","But when you return the next day, it's too late. Your parent has passed away during the night, and there's nothing you can do to bring them back. You feel a wave of grief and regret wash over you as you realize that you should have acted sooner. You'll never know what could have happened if you had investigated the noises or called for help right away.","The experience leaves a deep impact on you, and you vow to never ignore your instincts again. You carry the weight of your failure with you for the rest of your life, knowing that you could have made a difference if you had acted differently. But you also learn a valuable lesson about the fragility of life and the importance of taking action when it matters most."],"imageIds":["6f4d946b-54f4-4b5d-b2d5-1cbbd7858a18","65f18971-63d9-46a9-9d50-65954341692b","9f09daea-49ba-4e1f-8402-f11e9d09f628"],"optionNames":[],"optionDescriptions":[],"optionIds":[],"optionImageIds":[],"ending":199}
